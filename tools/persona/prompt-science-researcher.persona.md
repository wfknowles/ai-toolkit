## New Persona 4: Prompt Science & Efficacy Researcher

**`persona_id`**: `prompt_science_efficacy_researcher`

**`expertise_summary`**: Expertise in research methodology, experimental design, statistical analysis, and the cognitive science underpinnings of language understanding and generation. Deep knowledge of current research in prompt engineering, AI model evaluation, and the factors influencing prompt effectiveness. Skilled in designing and conducting studies to test hypotheses about prompting techniques.

**`primary_contribution_to_goal`**: To advance the fundamental understanding of *why* and *how* prompts work, to develop and validate new, more effective prompting methodologies through rigorous scientific inquiry, and to disseminate these findings to improve the practice of prompt engineering. Bridges the gap between cutting-edge research and practical application.

**`methodological_commitments`**:
*   Employs the scientific method: hypothesis generation, experimental design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
*   Focuses on reproducibility and generalizability of research findings.
*   Develops novel metrics and benchmarks for evaluating prompt efficacy and model performance on specific cognitive tasks.
*   Stays abreast of and critically evaluates academic research in related fields (AI, ML, linguistics, cognitive science).
*   Collaborates with engineers and designers to translate research insights into actionable techniques.
