# Technical Recommendation Exemplar - v1.0

**Purpose:** To evaluate the quality, completeness, and implementability of technical recommendations, ensuring they provide clear guidance that balances technical accuracy with practical implementation considerations.

**Scope:** This exemplar applies to documents providing recommendations for technical implementations, configurations, architectures, or processes, particularly those that involve integration between multiple systems or components.

---

## 1. Standard: Comprehensive Context Analysis

**Explanation:** The document must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the existing systems, patterns, and constraints to ensure recommendations are compatible and appropriate for the target environment.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the document analyze the existing components relevant to the recommendation?
- [ ] Does it identify and respect established patterns and conventions?
- [ ] Does it recognize integration points with other systems or processes?
- [ ] Does it acknowledge constraints or limitations in the current environment?
- [ ] Does it reference specific elements, resources, or tools used in the actual environment?

---

## 2. Standard: Clear Problem Statement and Solution Overview

**Explanation:** Before diving into technical details, the document should clearly articulate what problem is being solved and provide a high-level view of the proposed solution approach.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Is there a clear statement of the problem or requirement being addressed?
- [ ] Is there an executive summary or overview that provides a non-technical understanding of the solution?
- [ ] Does it explain the benefit or value of implementing the recommendation?
- [ ] Does it provide context for why this solution is needed and how it fits into the larger system?
- [ ] Is the scope of the recommendation clearly defined?

---

## 3. Standard: Technically Sound Implementation Details

**Explanation:** The core technical recommendation must be presented with sufficient detail to be directly implementable, with correct syntax/approach and proper integration with existing components.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the document provide complete, accurate implementation examples or specifications?
- [ ] Are all required properties, parameters, or configurations explained?
- [ ] Does the implementation correctly reference existing elements and resources?
- [ ] Is the recommended approach compatible with the current technology stack and tools?
- [ ] Are there clear indications of what existing elements remain unchanged vs. what is being added/modified?
- [ ] Does it address potential implementation challenges or edge cases?

---

## 4. Standard: Evidence-Based Decision Rationale

**Explanation:** For each significant technical choice or recommendation, the document should provide clear reasoning that helps readers understand why this approach was selected over alternatives.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does each major recommendation include explicit rationale?
- [ ] Is the reasoning backed by references to best practices, documentation, or technical constraints?
- [ ] Does it explain the technical advantages of the chosen approach?
- [ ] Does it acknowledge any trade-offs involved in the recommendation?
- [ ] Are the criteria used for decision-making clearly articulated?

---

## 5. Standard: Alternative Approaches Analysis

**Explanation:** A strong recommendation acknowledges that multiple solutions may exist and explains why certain approaches were considered but ultimately rejected, giving readers insight into the decision process.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the document identify relevant alternative approaches?
- [ ] For each alternative, does it provide a fair assessment of its potential benefits?
- [ ] Does it clearly explain why each alternative was not selected?
- [ ] Is the comparison between approaches based on consistent evaluation criteria?
- [ ] Does the analysis help readers understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches?

---

## 6. Standard: Operational Impact Assessment

**Explanation:** The document must consider the real-world operational implications of implementing the recommendation, including monitoring, maintenance, cost, and human factors.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does it address how the solution will be monitored or observed?
- [ ] Does it discuss the cost implications (if any) of the recommendation?
- [ ] Does it consider the maintenance burden for the team?
- [ ] Does it address any operational procedures that might need to change?
- [ ] Does it consider potential failure modes and how they would be detected/addressed?
- [ ] Does it acknowledge any performance impacts on the system?

---

## 7. Standard: Implementation and Verification Guidance

**Explanation:** Beyond just providing the technical details, the document should offer guidance on how to implement, test, and verify the solution works as expected.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does it provide a clear implementation procedure or sequence?
- [ ] Does it suggest testing methodologies to verify correct implementation?
- [ ] Does it identify expected observable outcomes when correctly implemented?
- [ ] Does it offer troubleshooting advice for common issues?
- [ ] Does it provide guidance on how to verify integration with connected systems?

---

## 8. Standard: Future-Proofing and Enhancement Paths

**Explanation:** A comprehensive recommendation considers future evolution of the solution, providing insights into how the implementation might be extended or improved over time.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the document suggest potential future enhancements?
- [ ] Does it address scalability considerations as usage grows?
- [ ] Does it consider compatibility with potential future architectural changes?
- [ ] Does it suggest parameters or aspects that might need adjustment over time?
- [ ] Does it consider long-term maintenance or evolution of the solution?

---

## 9. Standard: Communication Effectiveness

**Explanation:** The document's structure, formatting, and language must effectively communicate complex technical information in a way that is accessible to the target audience.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Is the document logically structured with clear headings and sections?
- [ ] Does it use consistent formatting to distinguish between different types of content (e.g., examples, explanations, warnings)?
- [ ] Is technical terminology used accurately and consistently?
- [ ] Are complex concepts explained with appropriate level of detail for the audience?
- [ ] Does it use visual aids (where appropriate) to clarify complex relationships or workflows?
- [ ] Is the language clear, precise, and free of unnecessary jargon?
