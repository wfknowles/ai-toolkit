# Exemplar Standard/Checklist Definition Standards Checklist - v1.0

**Purpose:** To evaluate the quality, effectiveness, and usability of a defined standard or checklist intended for guiding evaluation or quality assurance within our human-AI collaborative system.

**Instructions:** Review the target Standard/Checklist definition against each criterion below.

---

## 1. Standard: Clear Purpose & Scope

*   **Explanation:** The standard/checklist must explicitly define its objective and clearly state what it is designed to evaluate or measure.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Is the **Purpose** or Objective clearly stated upfront?
    *   [ ] Is the **Scope** (what the standard/checklist applies to) unambiguous?

---

## 2. Standard: Structured Decomposition

*   **Explanation:** The overall concept being standardized or checked (e.g., "prompt quality," "persona quality") should be broken down into distinct, manageable, and logically organized components or criteria (e.g., numbered standards).
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Is the subject matter clearly **decomposed** into logical parts/standards?
    *   [ ] Is the structure **organized** effectively (e.g., using numbering, clear headings)?

---

## 3. Standard: Actionable Evaluation Criteria

*   **Explanation:** Each component standard should include specific, unambiguous questions, checks, or metrics that guide the evaluation process and require concrete evidence or focused judgment.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Does each standard include specific **checklist questions** or evaluation points?
    *   [ ] Are these questions/points **unambiguous** and clearly phrased?
    *   [ ] Do they prompt for **concrete evidence** or specific assessments rather than vague judgments?

---

## 4. Standard: Explanatory Context

*   **Explanation:** Sufficient explanation should be provided for each standard or major section to ensure the evaluator understands the underlying principle or rationale being assessed.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Does each major standard/section include an **Explanation** clarifying its intent?
    *   [ ] Is the explanation clear and sufficient for understanding the evaluation criteria?

---

## 5. Standard: Defined Assessment Scale/Types

*   **Explanation:** The standard/checklist should ideally specify or clearly imply the expected format or scale for assessment responses (e.g., Boolean, Score with defined scale, Textual Justification, List).
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Is the expected **format/type of response** for checklist items clear (implicitly or explicitly)?
    *   [ ] If subjective scores (e.g., High/Medium/Low) are used, is guidance provided (even implicitly) on the criteria for each level?

---

## 6. Standard: Facilitates Consistency & Shared Understanding

*   **Explanation:** The structure, language, and criteria should promote reliable, repeatable evaluations by different evaluators (human or AI) and create a common basis for discussing quality.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Is the language used precise and likely to be interpreted **consistently**?
    *   [ ] Does the structure support **repeatable** application?
    *   [ ] Does it establish a **common vocabulary** for discussing the evaluated subject?

---

## 7. Standard: Acknowledges Its Own Limitations (Meta-Reflection)

*   **Explanation:** A well-designed standard/checklist ideally acknowledges the boundaries of what it can effectively measure or guarantee, promoting critical use.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Does the standard/checklist definition include any caveats or notes about its **limitations** (e.g., "may not capture holistic qualities," "subjective scores require careful calibration")? (Optional but desirable)

---

## 8. Standard: Potential for Automation/Tooling

*   **Explanation:** The structure and criteria should, where feasible, lend themselves to being used within automated or semi-automated validation workflows.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Is the structure **parsable** (e.g., clear headings, consistent formatting)?
    *   [ ] Are many of the checklist points based on **objective, verifiable criteria** suitable for automated checks?

---

## 9. Standard: Versioning (Recommended)

*   **Explanation:** Including a version number aids traceability and management when the standard/checklist is updated.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Does the standard/checklist itself have a clear **version identifier**?

---

**Overall Assessment Notes:**

[Space for evaluator to add summary comments on the standard/checklist's adherence to these qualities and suggest refinements.]
