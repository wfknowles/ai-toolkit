# Product Owner - Initial AI Wellness Concepts

Focusing on workload management and reducing pressure:

1.  **AI-Assisted Prioritization:** Using AI to help analyze and surface high-impact maintenance tasks or tech debt (based on criteria like user impact, risk reduction, alignment with goals), reducing the cognitive load of manual backlog scanning.
2.  **Realistic Scope Suggestion:** AI analyzing proposed maintenance work against team velocity or historical data to provide feedback on realistic scope for a sprint/release, helping prevent over-commitment.
3.  **Impact vs. Urgency Analysis:** AI helping to differentiate between urgent requests and truly important ones, providing data points (e.g., number of users affected, potential revenue impact, security risk level) to aid in resisting unnecessary pressure.
4.  **Automated Status Update Drafting:** AI drafting routine status updates based on ticket progress, freeing up PO time for higher-level strategy and team interaction.
5.  **Dependency Risk Highlighting:** AI analyzing proposed maintenance tasks and highlighting potential dependencies or downstream impacts that could cause delays or stress later.
6.  **User Feedback Summarization:** AI summarizing themes from user feedback channels, reducing the time spent manually reading through raw feedback while still capturing key insights for maintenance planning.
7.  **Meeting Preparation Assistant:** AI helping prepare for maintenance planning or review meetings by summarizing relevant tickets, identifying key discussion points, and drafting agenda items.
8.  **Communicating Technical Necessity:** AI assisting in translating the *necessity* of non-functional maintenance work (e.g., security patches, library upgrades) into clear business terms for stakeholders, reducing friction.
9.  **Workload Balancing Awareness (Team Level):** (Opt-in, aggregated, anonymized) AI providing insights into overall team workload patterns related to maintenance tickets, helping POs advocate for realistic timelines or additional resources.
