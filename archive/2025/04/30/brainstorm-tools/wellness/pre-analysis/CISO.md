# CISO - Initial AI Wellness Concepts

Focusing on governance, risk, compliance, and ethical oversight:

1.  **Ethical Use Policy for AI Wellness Features:** Establishing clear organizational policies defining the ethical boundaries for AI wellness features, emphasizing user control, privacy, non-diagnosis, and transparency (aligning with Prereq #2).
2.  **Data Governance for Wellness Data:** Defining strict data governance rules for any (opt-in) collected wellness pattern data, including classification, access control, retention schedules, and secure disposal, aligning with privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).
3.  **Third-Party Risk Assessment for Wellness Tools:** If any third-party components or AI models are used for wellness features, performing rigorous security and privacy assessments.
4.  **Compliance Oversight:** Ensuring all AI wellness features comply with relevant labor laws, health regulations (if applicable, though avoiding diagnosis is key), and data privacy laws.
5.  **Incident Response for Wellness Data Breach:** Including procedures in the IRP specifically addressing potential breaches or misuse of sensitive wellness-related user data or configurations.
6.  **Mandatory Opt-In & Consent Management:** Ensuring systems robustly enforce opt-in for any data collection/analysis beyond basic nudges, with clear consent language and easy withdrawal of consent.
7.  **Anonymization & Aggregation Strategy:** Defining the strategy for anonymizing and aggregating wellness pattern data if it's ever used for broader (opt-in) insights, ensuring individual privacy is protected.
8.  **Regular Ethical Review:** Establishing a process for periodic ethical review of AI wellness features, involving diverse stakeholders, to ensure they remain aligned with ethical principles and user expectations.
9.  **Training for Managers/HR on AI Wellness Data:** Explicitly defining that managers/HR have *no* access to individual AI wellness data or reflections, and training them on the purpose and limitations of any aggregated, anonymized insights (if ever implemented).
