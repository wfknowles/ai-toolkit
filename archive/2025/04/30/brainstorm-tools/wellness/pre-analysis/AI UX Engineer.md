# AI UX Engineer - Initial AI Wellness Concepts

Focusing on the design of the AI-wellness interaction itself:

1.  **User Control Interface for Wellness Features:** Designing a clear, intuitive interface for users to easily configure, enable/disable, and customize all wellness features (nudges, pattern analysis opt-in, persona preferences).
2.  **Non-Disruptive Nudge Design:** Designing nudge notifications (visual, auditory) that are noticeable but minimally disruptive to focused work, respecting flow state.
3.  **Transparency in Data Usage:** Clearly communicating within the UI *what* observable data is being used for wellness pattern analysis (if opt-in), *how* it's processed, and *where* it's stored.
4.  **Empathetic & Non-Judgmental AI Persona:** Crafting the default persona and language used for wellness interactions to be supportive, empathetic, and strictly non-judgmental (aligning with PE #9, Prereq #2).
5.  **Context-Aware Nudge Timing/Relevance:** Designing the UX logic so that nudges are delivered at appropriate moments (e.g., not during a critical debugging session identified by IDE context, but perhaps just after).
6.  **Progressive Disclosure of Features:** Introducing wellness features gradually, perhaps starting with simple nudges and only offering advanced pattern analysis after user trust is established and explicitly requested.
7.  **Visualizing Work Patterns (Opt-In):** Designing clear, simple visualizations for the opt-in "Wellbeing Mode" to help users understand their own work patterns (e.g., focus time vs. meetings, common interruption times) without prescriptive analysis.
8.  **Feedback Mechanism for Nudges:** Providing an easy way for users to give feedback on whether specific nudges were helpful, annoying, or mistimed, allowing the system to adapt (AOA #8).
9.  **Accessibility of Wellness Features:** Ensuring all wellness prompts, notifications, and configuration interfaces are fully accessible according to WCAG standards.
