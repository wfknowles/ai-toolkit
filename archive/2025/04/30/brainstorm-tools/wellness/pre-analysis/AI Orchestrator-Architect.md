# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial AI Wellness Concepts

Focusing on system architecture for enabling wellness features:

1.  **Wellness Event Bus:** Architecting an internal event system where different tools (IDE plugin, CI/CD, calendar, AI assistant) can publish observable, non-sensitive events (e.g., long session started, meeting ended, build failed, focus time block started).
2.  **Configurable Rules Engine for Nudges:** A central service that subscribes to the Wellness Event Bus and triggers configured nudges (from PE #1) based on user-defined rules (e.g., "IF session_duration > 60m THEN trigger break_nudge").
3.  **Opt-In Pattern Analysis Module ("Wellbeing Mode" Backend):** Designing the backend architecture for the optional "Wellbeing Mode", focusing on secure, privacy-preserving aggregation of observable work pattern data (e.g., session lengths, context switching frequency from IDE/VCS events) ONLY IF user opts in.
4.  **Privacy-Preserving Data Storage:** Architecting secure storage for any (opt-in) aggregated pattern data, ensuring strong encryption, access controls, and compliance with data retention/erasure policies.
5.  **Cross-Tool Context for Wellness:** Orchestration enabling the system to combine context from multiple sources for more relevant nudges (e.g., suggest a break *after* a calendar meeting ends AND IDE activity resumes).
6.  **API for User Wellness Preferences:** Designing an API for users to securely configure their wellness preferences (nudge frequency, timing, types, opt-in status for pattern analysis, preferred persona).
7.  **Decoupled Nudge Delivery System:** Architecting a flexible system to deliver nudges via different channels (IDE notification, chat message, OS notification) based on user preference and context.
8.  **Circuit Breaker for Annoying Nudges:** Implementing a mechanism where if the user repeatedly dismisses a certain type of nudge quickly, the system temporarily reduces its frequency to avoid irritation.
9.  **Federated Learning for Pattern Insights (Future):** Exploring (long-term, high complexity/risk) federated learning approaches where anonymized, aggregated pattern insights (NOT raw data) could potentially inform system-wide defaults or recommendations, ONLY with explicit user consent and strong privacy guarantees.
