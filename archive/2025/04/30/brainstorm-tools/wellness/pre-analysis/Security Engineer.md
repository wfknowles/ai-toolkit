# Security Engineer - Initial AI Wellness Concepts

Focusing on security aspects of wellness features and reducing security-related stress:

1.  **Secure Data Handling for Wellness Data:** Ensuring any (opt-in) collected or inferred wellness-related data (work patterns, preferences) is stored with robust encryption, strict access controls, and anonymization where possible.
2.  **Privacy Policy Transparency:** Clearly documenting the privacy implications, data collection, usage, and retention policies for any wellness features, especially pattern analysis.
3.  **Preventing Inference of Sensitive Information:** Designing pattern analysis (if used) to avoid inferring sensitive health information or making diagnoses â€“ focusing strictly on observable work patterns.
4.  **Secure Configuration Management for Wellness:** Ensuring the user's wellness preferences (opt-in status, nudge settings) are stored securely and cannot be tampered with.
5.  **Authentication/Authorization for Wellness API:** Securing the API used to manage user wellness preferences (AOA #6) against unauthorized access.
6.  **Reducing Security Alert Fatigue:** Using AI to intelligently filter, group, and prioritize security alerts presented to the engineer, reducing noise and focusing attention on critical issues, thereby lowering stress.
7.  **AI-Assisted Security Toil Reduction:** Automating repetitive security tasks (e.g., basic vulnerability scanning report analysis, compliance evidence gathering) to reduce engineer workload and potential burnout.
8.  **Secure Onboarding Agent:** Ensuring any "Onboarding Buddy" agent (AAE #6) does not inadvertently expose sensitive system information or credentials to new engineers.
9.  **Auditing Access to Wellness Data:** Implementing strict audit logs for any access to or modification of user wellness configuration or (opt-in) pattern data.
