# AI Agent Engineer - Initial AI Wellness Concepts

Focusing on agent capabilities supporting wellness goals:

1.  **Work Pattern Detection Agent (Opt-In):** An agent specifically designed for the "Wellbeing Mode" that analyzes permitted observable data streams (IDE events, calendar, task system APIs) to identify patterns relevant for user reflection (e.g., sustained long hours, high interrupt rate, low task completion rate).
2.  **Proactive Context Agent:** An agent that works ahead of the user (based on calendar or task list) to gather context, pre-load documentation, or set up environments, aiming to reduce user wait times and context-switching friction (related to SSE #6).
3.  **Toil Automation Agent:** Agents designed to reliably automate specific, user-delegated repetitive maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency bumps, linting fixes) to reduce developer drudgery (related to SSE #1).
4.  **Focus Protection Agent:** An agent that can (optionally) help manage notifications or non-urgent communications during user-defined focus blocks, summarizing them for later review.
5.  **Intelligent Summarization Agent:** Agents specialized in summarizing lengthy documents, codebases, or discussion threads quickly and accurately to reduce cognitive load.
6.  **Onboarding Buddy Agent:** An agent designed to assist engineers onboarding onto the Rails/Vue platform, answering common questions and pointing to relevant resources, reducing stress for both the new engineer and their mentors (related to PM #8).
7.  **Error Explanation Agent:** An agent specifically focused on analyzing complex stack traces or cryptic error messages from the Rails/Vue app and providing clear, step-by-step explanations and potential solutions.
8.  **Agent Usage Monitoring (for Wellness Insight):** (Opt-in, privacy-preserving) Analyzing *how* a user interacts with AI agents (e.g., frequent requests for basic explanations vs. complex automation) could provide reflective insights into areas of struggle or potential skill gaps, presented non-judgmentally.
9.  **Graceful Agent Failure Handling:** Designing agents that fail gracefully, provide clear explanations of failure, suggest alternative approaches, and avoid adding to user frustration when automation goes wrong.
