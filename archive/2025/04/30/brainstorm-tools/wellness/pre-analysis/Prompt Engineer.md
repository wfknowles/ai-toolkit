# Prompt Engineer - Initial AI Wellness Concepts

Focusing on prompt design for wellness nudges and reflection:

1.  **Configurable Nudge Prompts:** Designing prompt templates for gentle nudges (breaks, hydration, posture checks, end-of-day wrap-up) that are easily configurable by the user (frequency, timing, tone).
2.  **Mindful Transition Prompts:** Crafting prompts triggered by context shifts (e.g., closing a complex debugging task) that suggest a brief pause or mindful transition activity before diving into the next task.
3.  **Reflective Practice Prompts (Opt-In):** Developing non-judgmental prompts for the "Wellbeing Mode" that encourage self-reflection on work patterns, e.g., "You handled several high-priority interrupts today. How did that affect your planned work?" (Strictly opt-in, based on observable data like ticket interactions).
4.  **Positive Reinforcement Prompts:** Designing prompts that acknowledge completed tasks or milestones (based on VCS or task system data) with brief, non-excessive positive reinforcement, configurable by user preference.
5.  **Focus Assist Prompt:** A prompt that helps the user regain focus after an interruption by summarizing the previous context and suggesting the next logical step, potentially reducing cognitive load.
6.  **Boundary Setting Prompts:** Prompts triggered near configured end-of-day times that assist the user in planning the *next* day's tasks or drafting hand-off notes, facilitating disengagement.
7.  **Learning Reflection Prompt:** After learning a new concept or using a new tool (potentially detected via AI interaction), a prompt suggesting the user take a moment to jot down key takeaways or questions, aiding retention and reducing cognitive strain.
8.  **"Unstuck" Prompt with Calming Tone:** If the AI detects repeated errors or struggles with a problem (based on interaction patterns), offer help using a calm, encouraging tone, perhaps suggesting alternative approaches or breaking the problem down, while reminding the user it's okay to step away.
9.  **Customizable Wellness Persona Prompt:** Allowing the user to define the persona/tone of the wellness prompts/nudges (e.g., "Coach", "Calm Assistant", "Just the Facts").
