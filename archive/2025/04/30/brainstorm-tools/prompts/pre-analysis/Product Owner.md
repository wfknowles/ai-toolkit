# Product Owner - Initial Concepts

From a product perspective, focusing on value and user impact during maintenance:

1.  **Bug Prioritization Assistant:** A prompt that analyzes a bug report (including technical details if available, user impact descriptions) and suggests a priority level based on configured criteria (e.g., number of users affected, business impact, workaround availability).
2.  **Maintenance Release Note Generation:** A prompt that takes a list of resolved issues/tasks (e.g., JIRA ticket IDs, commit messages) and generates user-friendly release notes summarizing the fixes and improvements for different audiences (internal stakeholders, end-users).
3.  **User Impact Assessment for Technical Debt:** A prompt that analyzes identified technical debt items (provided with context from engineers) and helps articulate the potential user-facing impact (e.g., future feature delays, performance degradation risk, reliability issues) to justify prioritization.
4.  **A/B Test Plan for Risky Fixes:** A prompt to help design an A/B test or canary release plan for a maintenance change that carries a risk of unintended consequences, outlining metrics to monitor and success/rollback criteria.
5.  **Translating Technical Constraints into Product Terms:** A prompt that takes technical explanations for maintenance needs (e.g., "need to upgrade database version", "refactor authentication module") and helps translate them into business implications and user value (e.g., improved security, faster login, enables future feature X).
6.  **Feature Flag Management Strategy:** A prompt to help decide if a maintenance fix should be deployed behind a feature flag, considering factors like risk, rollback complexity, and the need for phased rollout.
7.  **Gathering User Sentiment on Stability:** A prompt designed to analyze user feedback channels (support tickets, forums, social media) specifically for comments related to system stability, performance, or recent bugs, summarizing trends after a maintenance release.
8.  **Communicating Downtime/Maintenance Windows:** A prompt to help draft clear and concise communication to users and stakeholders regarding planned maintenance windows, explaining the necessity, timing, and expected impact.
9.  **Validating Fixes from a User Perspective:** A prompt that takes a bug description and the implemented fix details (e.g., code diff summary) and generates user acceptance testing (UAT) scenarios to validate that the fix addresses the original user-reported problem effectively.
