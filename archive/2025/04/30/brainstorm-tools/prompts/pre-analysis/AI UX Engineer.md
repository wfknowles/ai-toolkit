# AI UX Engineer - Initial Concepts

Focusing on the user experience of AI tools used *during* the maintenance process itself:

1.  **Context-Aware Prompt Suggestion:** An AI system that observes an engineer's current maintenance task context (e.g., file open, error message in console) and proactively suggests relevant AI prompts (like code explanation, test generation) and pre-fills context.
2.  **Interactive Debugging Explanation:** Instead of static code explanations, a prompt interface that allows engineers to ask follow-up questions about a bug analysis provided by AI, drilling down into specific logic paths or variable states.
3.  **Visualizing Code Refactoring Impact:** A prompt linked to a visualization tool that shows the proposed 'before' and 'after' structure of code following an AI-suggested refactoring, highlighting changes in complexity or dependencies.
4.  **Natural Language Interface for Log Querying:** A prompt that translates natural language queries about system behavior (e.g., "Show me all login errors for user X in the last hour") into the appropriate log query syntax for the specific logging system being used.
5.  **Confidence Scoring and Explainability for AI Suggestions:** Designing prompts that explicitly ask the AI to provide a confidence score for its suggestions (e.g., bug fixes, refactoring) and a brief explanation of its reasoning, helping engineers gauge trustworthiness.
6.  **Feedback Loop for AI Tool Improvement:** A prompt embedded within AI maintenance tools that makes it easy for engineers to provide feedback on the usefulness or accuracy of AI suggestions, capturing context for fine-tuning.
7.  **Summarization of Lengthy AI Outputs:** For AI tools that generate verbose outputs (e.g., detailed code analysis, extensive log summaries), a secondary prompt to summarize the key findings, action items, or most critical information.
8.  **Personalized Maintenance Task Dashboard:** A concept for an interface where prompts could configure a personalized dashboard for an engineer, showing relevant metrics, assigned maintenance tickets, and AI-suggested tasks based on their expertise or current focus.
9.  **On-the-Fly Prompt Chaining UI:** A user interface that allows engineers to easily chain multiple AI prompts together (e.g., "Find relevant code for this bug ticket" -> "Suggest a fix for this code" -> "Generate unit tests for the fix") without complex scripting.
