# Project Manager - Initial Concepts

Focusing on planning, tracking, and communication aspects of software maintenance:

1.  **Maintenance Task Breakdown & Estimation:** A prompt that takes a high-level maintenance requirement (e.g., "Upgrade framework X", "Address security audit findings") and suggests a breakdown of engineering tasks, estimating effort based on historical data or complexity analysis.
2.  **Risk Assessment for Maintenance Projects:** A prompt that analyzes a planned maintenance activity (scope, dependencies, team availability) and identifies potential risks (e.g., schedule slippage, resource conflicts, unexpected technical hurdles), suggesting mitigation strategies.
3.  **Stakeholder Communication Update Generation:** A prompt that takes current progress on maintenance tasks (e.g., completed tickets, ongoing work, blockers) and generates a concise status update tailored for different stakeholders (e.g., leadership, dependent teams).
4.  **Resource Allocation Optimization:** A prompt that analyzes the backlog of maintenance tasks, team member skills/availability, and task priorities to suggest an optimal allocation of engineers to tasks for a given period.
5.  **Dependency Tracking & Alerting:** A prompt designed to monitor dependencies between different maintenance tasks or across teams, alerting the PM when potential blockers or delays arise.
6.  **Maintenance Burn-down Chart Analysis:** A prompt that analyzes burn-down or burn-up chart data for a maintenance release/sprint, identifies trends (e.g., scope creep, slow progress), and suggests potential causes or corrective actions.
7.  **Post-Mortem Meeting Facilitation Outline:** A prompt that generates an agenda and talking points for a post-mortem meeting following a significant maintenance event or incident, ensuring key areas like timeline, impact, root cause, and lessons learned are covered.
8.  **Change Management Process Guidance:** A prompt that, given details of a proposed maintenance change, guides the user through the organization's defined change management process, ensuring all necessary approvals and documentation steps are considered.
9.  **Knowledge Transfer Plan Generation:** A prompt that helps create a plan for transferring knowledge about a recently maintained or updated system component, identifying key information and suggesting methods (e.g., documentation update, brown bag session, pair programming).
