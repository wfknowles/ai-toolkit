# Senior Software Engineer - Initial Concepts

Focusing on practical application during maintenance from an engineering perspective:

1.  **Complex Bug Analysis Assistant:** A prompt that helps debug complex issues by allowing interactive querying of code execution paths, variable states (based on static analysis or provided context), and potential race conditions described in natural language.
2.  **Legacy Code Understanding & Modernization:** A prompt designed to analyze sections of legacy code, explain its functionality, identify outdated patterns or libraries, and suggest modernization approaches (e.g., migrating to newer frameworks, breaking down monoliths).
3.  **Performance Bottleneck Identification:** A prompt that analyzes code structure, database query patterns (if provided), or profiling data to pinpoint likely performance bottlenecks and suggest specific optimizations.
4.  **Test Case Generation for Edge Cases:** A prompt that analyzes existing tests and code logic for a specific function/module and suggests additional test cases targeting potential edge cases, boundary conditions, or error handling paths often missed.
5.  **Code Review Automation (Specific Checks):** A prompt focused on specific, hard-to-automate checks during code review, such as validating complex business logic implementation against requirements, checking for subtle concurrency issues, or ensuring proper resource management (e.g., closing file handles, releasing locks).
6.  **Generating Data Migration Scripts:** A prompt that takes source and target database schemas (or data models) and a description of the required transformation logic, then generates a draft data migration script (e.g., SQL, Python).
7.  **Configuration File Validation & Explanation:** A prompt that parses complex configuration files (e.g., Kubernetes manifests, Terraform scripts, CI/CD pipelines), validates syntax and semantics, explains the purpose of different sections, and flags potential misconfigurations.
8.  **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Draft Generation:** A prompt that takes incident details (timeline, symptoms, logs snippets, changes deployed) and generates a structured first draft of an RCA document, identifying contributing factors and potential corrective actions.
9.  **Knowledge Base Query for Maintenance Procedures:** A prompt optimized to search internal documentation (wikis, past tickets, runbooks) for specific maintenance procedures, troubleshooting steps, or architectural context relevant to a current task.
