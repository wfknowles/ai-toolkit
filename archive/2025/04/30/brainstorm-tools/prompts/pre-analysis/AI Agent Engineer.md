# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Concepts

Focusing on building autonomous or semi-autonomous agents for maintenance tasks:

1.  **Automated Dependency Update Agent:** An agent prompted with the goal of keeping dependencies up-to-date. It scans for updates, uses other prompts/tools to analyze impact, attempts automated code modifications for simple updates, runs tests, and creates pull requests for review.
2.  **Self-Healing Agent for Common Production Issues:** An agent prompted to monitor specific error patterns or alerts. When triggered, it executes a predefined diagnostic workflow (using various prompts/tools), attempts automated fixes (e.g., restarting a service, clearing a cache), and verifies the resolution.
3.  **Technical Debt Reduction Agent:** An agent prompted to periodically scan the codebase for specific types of technical debt (e.g., using static analysis prompts), attempt automated refactoring for predefined safe patterns, and submit changes for review.
4.  **Code Review Assistant Agent:** An agent prompted to perform parts of the code review process, focusing on style guide adherence, detection of common anti-patterns, checking for missing tests, or validating documentation presence, providing feedback directly on the pull request.
5.  **Security Patching Agent:** An agent prompted to monitor vulnerability feeds (e.g., CVE databases). When a relevant vulnerability is found, it identifies affected code/dependencies, searches for official patches or vendor guidance, attempts to apply the patch, runs tests, and flags results for security team review.
6.  **Log Anomaly Detection & Alerting Agent:** An agent continuously processing logs, prompted to identify deviations from normal patterns, correlate anomalies with recent deployments or known issues, and generate targeted alerts with summarized context.
7.  **Documentation Update Agent:** An agent prompted to detect code changes (e.g., API signature modifications, new config options) and automatically update relevant sections of the documentation (e.g., READMEs, API specs, wikis), potentially drafting content for human review.
8.  **Intelligent Test Data Generation Agent:** An agent prompted with a code module or API endpoint description that generates realistic and diverse test data, including edge cases and potentially sensitive data masking, for use in maintenance testing.
9.  **Environment Provisioning/Cleanup Agent for Maintenance:** An agent prompted to automatically provision temporary testing or staging environments needed for specific maintenance tasks and ensure they are properly torn down afterward to manage costs and resources.
