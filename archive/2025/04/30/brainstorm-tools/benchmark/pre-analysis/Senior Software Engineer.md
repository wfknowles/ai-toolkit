# Senior Software Engineer - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on using exemplars for code quality and technical tasks:

1.  **Exemplar Code Pattern Application:** Providing an AI with an exemplar implementation of a design pattern (e.g., Singleton, Strategy) and asking it to refactor existing code to use that pattern correctly.
2.  **Benchmark-Based Code Review:** Manually or automatically comparing a proposed code change against a relevant benchmark exemplar (e.g., a similar feature implemented with high quality) to identify deviations in style, structure, or completeness.
3.  **Exemplary Unit Test Generation:** Using a high-quality unit test file as an exemplar to prompt the AI to generate tests for new code, matching the exemplar's coverage, mocking strategies, and assertion clarity.
4.  **API Design Conformance to Exemplar:** Evaluating a newly designed API endpoint against an established benchmark API design exemplar for consistency in naming conventions, error handling, and HATEOAS principles.
5.  **Performance Benchmark Comparison:** Using AI to help analyze the performance test results of a code change against a pre-defined performance benchmark (based on a previous version or an exemplar implementation) to identify regressions.
6.  **Exemplar-Driven Refactoring:** Providing an exemplar of well-refactored code (e.g., extracted methods, simplified conditionals) and asking the AI to apply similar refactoring techniques to a selected complex function.
7.  **Secure Coding Exemplars:** Using examples of code that correctly implement security controls (e.g., input validation, output encoding, proper authentication checks) as few-shot exemplars when asking AI to write or fix security-sensitive code.
8.  **Documentation Quality Benchmark:** Evaluating generated documentation (e.g., function comments, README sections) against a high-quality documentation exemplar for clarity, completeness, and accuracy.
9.  **Troubleshooting Guide Exemplars:** Referencing an exemplar troubleshooting guide for a similar past issue when asking AI to help diagnose a new problem or draft a new troubleshooting guide.
