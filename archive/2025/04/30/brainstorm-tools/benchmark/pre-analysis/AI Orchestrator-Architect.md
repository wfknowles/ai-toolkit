# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on system-level use of benchmarks and exemplars:

1.  **Exemplar Repository & Retrieval (RAG for Exemplars):** Architecting a system (likely using RAG) to store, index, and retrieve relevant exemplars (code patterns, documentation sections, design diagrams) to be automatically injected into prompts by the orchestrator based on task type.
2.  **Benchmark-Driven Quality Gates:** Integrating automated checks into CI/CD pipelines where AI evaluates generated code, documentation, or test plans against defined benchmark exemplars before allowing progression.
3.  **AI Performance Benchmarking:** Using a standardized set of tasks and corresponding exemplars to benchmark the performance (quality, speed, cost) of different LLMs or prompt strategies for specific maintenance activities.
4.  **Exemplar-Based Agent Training/Fine-tuning:** Utilizing a curated dataset of high-quality exemplars (input task + benchmark output) to fine-tune smaller, specialized models or train agents for specific maintenance tasks (e.g., code refactoring, bug fixing).
5.  **Workflow Template from Exemplar:** An orchestration workflow that analyzes an exemplar work product (e.g., a complex troubleshooting guide) and generates a reusable workflow template (sequence of steps/prompts) to replicate that process.
6.  **Automated Exemplar Identification:** Designing an AI system that monitors completed work products (e.g., merged PRs, published documents) and flags potential candidates to become new benchmark exemplars based on quality metrics or human feedback.
7.  **Cross-Exemplar Pattern Synthesis:** An advanced AI capability that analyzes a collection of exemplars for a specific task type (e.g., multiple high-quality API designs) and synthesizes underlying best practices or common patterns.
8.  **Benchmark Drift Detection:** Periodically re-evaluating AI outputs or agent performance against established benchmarks to detect drift in quality or consistency over time as models or prompts change.
9.  **Resource Allocation Based on Benchmark Complexity:** Using the complexity of a relevant benchmark exemplar as an input factor for estimating the effort or resources required for a similar new task.
