# Project Manager - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on using exemplars for planning, reporting, and process consistency:

1.  **Exemplar Project Plan:** Using a well-structured project plan from a similar past maintenance project as an exemplar to guide AI in drafting a plan for a new initiative (tasks, milestones, dependencies).
2.  **Benchmark Status Report:** Referencing a clear and concise status report exemplar when prompting AI to generate draft reports, ensuring key information (progress, blockers, risks) is included.
3.  **Exemplar Risk Assessment:** Using a thorough risk assessment document from a previous project as an exemplar to guide AI in identifying and evaluating potential risks for a new maintenance task.
4.  **Benchmark Change Request:** Utilizing an exemplar change request document that meets quality standards (clear justification, impact analysis, test plan) to help AI draft or evaluate new change requests.
5.  **Exemplar Post-Mortem Report:** Referencing a high-quality post-mortem report exemplar to guide AI in structuring and drafting a report after a maintenance incident.
6.  **Resource Estimation Benchmark:** Using historical data or an exemplar project plan as a benchmark when asking AI to provide effort estimates for similar types of maintenance tasks.
7.  **Communication Plan Exemplar:** Employing an exemplar communication plan (defining stakeholders, frequency, channels) to guide AI in drafting a comms plan for a specific maintenance event.
8.  **Process Documentation Exemplar:** Using an exemplar of well-documented team process (e.g., branching strategy, deployment checklist) as a benchmark when asking AI to generate or update process documentation.
9.  **Kick-off Meeting Agenda Exemplar:** Referencing an effective kick-off meeting agenda exemplar when asking AI to help prepare the agenda for a new maintenance project.
