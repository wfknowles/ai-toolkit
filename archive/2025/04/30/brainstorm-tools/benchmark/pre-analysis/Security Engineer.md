# Security Engineer - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on using exemplars for security standards and practices:

1.  **Secure Coding Practice Exemplars:** Using curated code snippets demonstrating secure implementation of common patterns (e.g., authentication, input validation, crypto) as few-shot exemplars for AI code generation or review prompts.
2.  **Benchmark Security Configuration:** Establishing benchmark configuration files (e.g., for firewalls, IAM policies, Kubernetes network policies) representing a secure baseline, used to evaluate new configurations or AI-generated config.
3.  **Exemplar Security Test Cases:** Utilizing examples of well-written security test cases (e.g., testing for OWASP Top 10 vulns) as exemplars to guide AI in generating security tests for new features or fixes.
4.  **Vulnerability Report Exemplar:** Using a high-quality vulnerability report (clear description, impact assessment, reproduction steps, remediation advice) as an exemplar when asking AI to help draft reports for newly found vulnerabilities.
5.  **Threat Model Exemplar:** Referencing an exemplar threat model document (e.g., using STRIDE or DREAD) for a similar system or feature when prompting AI to assist with threat modeling a new component.
6.  **Security Architecture Pattern Exemplars:** Using documented secure architecture patterns (e.g., zero trust, defense in depth) as exemplars or benchmarks when evaluating the design of systems undergoing maintenance.
7.  **Incident Response Playbook Exemplar:** Employing an exemplar incident response playbook for a specific type of attack (e.g., ransomware, DDoS) as a benchmark to evaluate or generate playbooks for other scenarios.
8.  **Negative Exemplars (Insecure Code):** Using examples of code with known vulnerabilities as negative exemplars in prompts to explicitly instruct AI on patterns to avoid.
9.  **Compliance Evidence Exemplars:** Utilizing examples of acceptable evidence documentation for specific compliance controls (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) as benchmarks when generating or reviewing compliance evidence.
