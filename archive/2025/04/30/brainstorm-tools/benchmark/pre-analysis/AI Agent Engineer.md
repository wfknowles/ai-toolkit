# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on using exemplars to guide agent behavior and evaluation:

1.  **Exemplar Task Execution Trace:** Using a trace log of a successful, high-quality execution of a task by an agent as an exemplar to guide or debug the behavior of other agents performing the same task.
2.  **Benchmark Agent Performance Metrics:** Defining benchmark metrics (e.g., task completion rate, execution time, resource consumption, adherence to instructions) based on an exemplar agent or execution run, used to evaluate new agent versions.
3.  **Exemplar-Driven Agent Planning:** Prompting an agent's planning module with an exemplar plan for a similar task to guide its own plan generation.
4.  **Tool Usage Exemplars:** Providing agents with exemplars of correct and efficient usage of specific tools (APIs, CLI commands) within their prompts or training data.
5.  **Exemplar for Agent Self-Correction:** Giving an agent an exemplar of a correctly completed task and asking it to compare its own failed or suboptimal execution trace against the exemplar to identify its mistakes.
6.  **Failure Mode Exemplars:** Using documented examples of common agent failure modes as negative exemplars during testing or prompt design to make agents more robust.
7.  **Exemplar Interaction Protocols (Multi-Agent):** Defining benchmark protocols or message sequences for inter-agent communication based on successful past collaborations, used to train or evaluate new multi-agent systems.
8.  **Resource Management Benchmark:** Using an exemplar execution trace to establish a benchmark for expected resource usage (e.g., API calls, tokens consumed) for a specific agent task.
9.  **Testing Agent Robustness Against Benchmarks:** Evaluating how well an agent performs on a benchmark task when faced with variations or noise introduced into the inputs or environment, compared to its performance in the ideal benchmark scenario.
