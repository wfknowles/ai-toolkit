# AI UX Engineer - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on using exemplars to design and evaluate AI interactions:

1.  **Exemplar AI Interaction Flow:** Using a documented, high-quality user flow for an AI feature as an exemplar when designing or evaluating new AI-driven interactions.
2.  **Benchmark AI Response Quality:** Defining benchmark exemplars for different types of AI responses (e.g., code explanations, error messages, suggestions) based on criteria like clarity, conciseness, accuracy, and tone.
3.  **Exemplar Onboarding Experience:** Using an exemplar of a successful AI feature onboarding flow as a benchmark when designing onboarding for new AI capabilities.
4.  **UI Consistency Benchmark:** Referencing exemplar UI components or layouts used in existing AI features to ensure consistency when designing interfaces for new AI tools.
5.  **Exemplar for Handling Ambiguity:** Using examples of how an AI gracefully handled ambiguous user input or missing context as exemplars when designing similar fallback or clarification behaviors.
6.  **Accessibility Benchmark for AI Output:** Defining exemplars of AI-generated content (e.g., image descriptions, summaries) that meet accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to benchmark outputs from new AI features.
7.  **Exemplar User Feedback Prompt:** Using an effective prompt for soliciting user feedback on an AI feature as an exemplar when designing feedback mechanisms for other AI tools.
8.  **Task Success Rate Benchmark:** Establishing benchmark task success rates (based on user testing with an exemplar AI interaction) against which new iterations or alternative AI designs can be measured.
9.  **Ethical Interaction Exemplars:** Curating exemplars of AI interactions that demonstrate ethical principles (transparency, fairness, avoiding manipulation) to guide the design of new AI features.
