# Product Owner - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on using exemplars for requirements, communication, and value alignment:

1.  **Exemplar User Stories:** Using well-written user stories (clear, concise, testable, meeting INVEST criteria) as exemplars when prompting AI to help draft new stories or refine existing ones.
2.  **Benchmark Acceptance Criteria:** Referencing exemplar acceptance criteria for a similar feature to ensure newly generated criteria are comprehensive, unambiguous, and cover key scenarios.
3.  **Exemplar Release Notes:** Using a past set of effective release notes as a benchmark exemplar for tone, structure, and level of detail when generating notes for a new maintenance release.
4.  **Benchmark Product Brief/Spec:** Comparing an AI-assisted draft of a product brief or specification document against a high-quality exemplar brief/spec to ensure sufficient detail and strategic alignment.
5.  **Exemplar UAT Plan:** Utilizing an exemplar User Acceptance Testing plan to guide the AI in generating a UAT plan for a new fix or feature, ensuring coverage of key user workflows.
6.  **Customer Communication Exemplars:** Using examples of effective customer communication (e.g., outage notifications, feedback responses) as benchmarks when asking AI to draft similar communications.
7.  **Benchmark Competitor Feature:** Analyzing a competitor's feature implementation as a (potentially negative or positive) benchmark when defining requirements or improvements for a similar feature in our product.
8.  **Exemplar Prioritization Rationale:** Using a well-justified prioritization decision from the past as an exemplar to guide AI in evaluating or articulating the rationale for prioritizing a new maintenance task or bug fix.
9.  **A/B Test Design Exemplar:** Referencing a well-designed A/B test plan (clear hypothesis, metrics, segments) as an exemplar when asking AI to help design a new test for a maintenance change.
