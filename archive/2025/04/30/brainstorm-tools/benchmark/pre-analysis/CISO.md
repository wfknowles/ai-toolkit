# CISO - Initial Exemplar/Benchmark Usage Concepts

Focusing on using exemplars for governance, risk, and compliance standards:

1.  **Benchmark Security Policy:** Using a well-drafted, comprehensive security policy document (either internal or from a reputable source) as an exemplar when generating or reviewing organizational security policies, especially regarding AI usage.
2.  **Exemplar Risk Assessment Methodology:** Referencing an exemplar risk assessment report or methodology document to ensure AI-assisted risk assessments follow a consistent, high-quality process.
3.  **Compliance Framework Benchmark:** Using a specific compliance framework (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001) itself as the benchmark against which AI tools evaluate system configurations or processes.
4.  **Exemplar Vendor Security Assessment:** Utilizing an exemplar vendor security questionnaire or assessment report as a benchmark for evaluating the security posture of AI tool vendors.
5.  **Benchmark Incident Response Maturity:** Comparing the organization's AI-assisted incident response capabilities or playbooks against an industry benchmark or maturity model (e.g., NIST SP 800-61).
6.  **Ethical AI Principle Exemplars:** Using established ethical AI frameworks or principles (e.g., from OECD, EU AI Act guidelines) as benchmarks when evaluating the ethical implications of AI systems used in maintenance.
7.  **Security Awareness Training Exemplars:** Referencing highly effective security awareness training modules or materials as exemplars when developing new AI-driven or AI-related training content.
8.  **Benchmark Data Handling Procedures:** Using exemplar procedures for handling sensitive data (classification, encryption, access control, disposal) as a benchmark for processes involving AI systems that touch such data.
9.  **Exemplar Board Reporting:** Utilizing examples of effective cybersecurity reports presented to the board as benchmarks for clarity, relevance, and impact when preparing AI-related risk communications.
