# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Context Management Concepts

Focusing on how autonomous agents manage and utilize context for long-running tasks:

1.  **Agent Working Memory:** Implementing a structured short-term memory for agents to store intermediate results, observations, and current task state, which informs subsequent steps in their plan.
2.  **Contextual Planning and Re-planning:** Designing agents that use their current context (task status, environmental feedback, errors) to dynamically adjust their plans, rather than rigidly following a pre-defined script.
3.  **Selective Context Attention:** Building mechanisms (potentially using LLMs themselves) for agents to determine which parts of their accumulated context or external information are most relevant for the immediate next action, avoiding information overload.
4.  **Contextual Tool Selection:** Enabling agents to choose the appropriate tool (API call, database query, code execution) based not just on the goal, but also on the available context (e.g., choosing a different tool if certain data is missing in the context).
5.  **Long-Term Context Summarization for Agents:** Developing strategies for agents to periodically summarize their experiences or key learnings from long-running tasks into a condensed long-term memory, preventing infinite context growth.
6.  **Environment Sensing as Context:** Agents actively probing their environment (e.g., checking file existence, API health, system status) to update their context before taking actions.
7.  **Error Handling Context:** Agents storing context about past errors and failed attempts to avoid repeating mistakes or to inform alternative strategies.
8.  **Hierarchical Context Management:** Structuring agent context hierarchically (e.g., overall goal context, current plan context, current step context) to manage complexity.
9.  **Inter-Agent Context Exchange Protocol:** Defining standardized formats and protocols for multiple agents collaborating on a task to securely and efficiently exchange relevant context or findings.
