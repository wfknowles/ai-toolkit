# CISO - Initial Context Management Concepts

Focusing on governance, risk, and compliance related to context management:

1.  **Data Governance Policy for Context:** Establishing clear policies defining what types of data are permissible as context for different AI tools/use cases, especially regarding sensitive or regulated data.
2.  **Context Handling in Third-Party AI Risk Assessment:** Including specific questions and requirements about context handling, security, and data privacy in vendor risk assessments for AI tools.
3.  **Compliance Mapping for Context Management:** Ensuring that context management practices (storage, access, retrieval, sanitization) align with relevant regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, etc.).
4.  **Incident Response Plan for Context Breach:** Developing specific procedures within the overall IR plan to address incidents involving compromised or leaked context data used by AI systems.
5.  **Defining Context Retention Policies:** Setting clear retention schedules for stored context (e.g., conversation history, agent memory logs) based on business needs and compliance requirements.
6.  **Training & Awareness on Context Security:** Educating developers and users on the security risks associated with context (e.g., prompt injection via context, leakage of sensitive data) and best practices for secure handling.
7.  **Approval Process for Context Sources:** Implementing a process for reviewing and approving new internal or external data sources intended for use as context in RAG or other AI systems.
8.  **Contextual Risk Scoring:** Developing a methodology to assess the inherent risk associated with different types of context data, informing the level of security controls required.
9.  **Right to Erasure/Forgetfulness in Context:** Designing systems and processes to ensure compliance with data subject rights, including the ability to delete specific user data from stored context logs or agent memories.
