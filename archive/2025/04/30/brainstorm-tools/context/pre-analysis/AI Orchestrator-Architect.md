# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial Context Management Concepts

Focusing on managing context across complex workflows, agents, and systems:

1.  **Contextual Routing Engine:** An orchestrator component that analyzes the incoming query and available context sources (databases, APIs, conversation history) to determine which specialized agent/prompt chain is best suited and routes the request accordingly, passing only the relevant context subset.
2.  **Dynamic Context Retrieval (RAG Orchestration):** Orchestrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation where prompts dynamically query vector databases or knowledge graphs based on the immediate query, retrieving only the most relevant context chunks for the LLM, rather than pre-loading static context.
3.  **Stateful Context Management Service:** A dedicated microservice that maintains the state and context for ongoing multi-turn interactions or agent tasks. Prompts/agents query this service for needed context and update it with new information, keeping individual prompts lighter.
4.  **Context Condensation/Expansion Loop:** An orchestration pattern where context is summarized before calling a core LLM, but the orchestrator retains the full context. If the LLM needs more detail (indicated by its output or a confidence score), the orchestrator expands the context selectively and re-prompts.
5.  **Shared Context Memory for Multi-Agent Systems:** Designing a shared blackboard or memory system where multiple collaborating agents can read and write contextual information, allowing them to build upon each other's findings without passing large context payloads directly.
6.  **Contextual Scoping based on Workflow Stage:** Varying the scope and type of context provided to prompts based on their stage in a larger workflow (e.g., initial planning stage gets high-level goals, detailed execution stage gets specific code/data snippets).
7.  **Automated Context Extraction from Unstructured Data:** A workflow step that uses an LLM specifically trained/prompted to extract structured context (key entities, relationships, constraints) from unstructured sources (emails, documents, meeting transcripts) before feeding it into task-specific prompts.
8.  **Context Caching Layer:** Implementing a caching mechanism for frequently retrieved or generated context (e.g., user profiles, system configurations) to reduce latency and redundant processing in orchestration flows.
9.  **Cross-Domain Context Federation:** Architecting a system that can securely retrieve and combine context from different domains or data silos (e.g., combining customer data from CRM with technical data from monitoring tools) for complex, cross-functional prompts.
