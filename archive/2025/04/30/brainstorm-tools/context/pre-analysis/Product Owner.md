# Product Owner - Initial Context Management Concepts

Focusing on providing business, user, and product context:

1.  **User Persona Context:** Including relevant user persona details (goals, pain points, technical proficiency) as context for prompts generating user stories, UI text, or evaluating feature usability.
2.  **Product Goals & Strategy Context:** Providing high-level product goals, OKRs, or strategic pillars as context to ensure AI-generated feature ideas, requirements, or prioritization suggestions align with the overall product direction.
3.  **Competitor Analysis Context:** Summarizing key features or strategies of competitors as context when brainstorming new features or drafting competitive positioning statements.
4.  **User Story/Requirement Context:** Using existing user stories, epics, or requirement documents as context for prompts generating test cases, acceptance criteria, or technical breakdown tasks.
5.  **Customer Feedback Context:** Summarizing recent customer feedback themes (from surveys, support tickets, interviews) as context for prompts related to bug prioritization, feature improvement ideas, or release note drafting.
6.  **Market Segment Context:** Providing details about the target market segment (industry, size, specific needs) as context when tailoring feature descriptions or marketing copy.
7.  **Business Constraints Context:** Explicitly stating business constraints (e.g., budget limitations, deadlines, compliance requirements, brand guidelines) as context to ensure AI suggestions are realistic and permissible.
8.  **A/B Test Results Context:** Using the results and learnings from past A/B tests as context when designing new experiments or iterating on features.
9.  **Product Roadmap Context:** Providing the relevant section of the product roadmap (upcoming features, dependencies) as context when assessing the feasibility or priority of new requests or maintenance tasks.
