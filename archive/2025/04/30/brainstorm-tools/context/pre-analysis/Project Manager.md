# Project Manager - Initial Context Management Concepts

Focusing on project status, resources, risks, and process context:

1.  **Project Plan/Timeline Context:** Providing key milestones, deadlines, and dependencies from the project plan as context for prompts related to task scheduling, risk assessment, or status reporting.
2.  **Team Availability & Skills Context:** Including information about team members' availability (e.g., PTO, other commitments) and skill sets as context for prompts suggesting task assignments or resource allocation.
3.  **Budget & Resource Allocation Context:** Providing budget constraints and current resource allocation status as context for prompts evaluating the feasibility of new requests or suggesting resource adjustments.
4.  **Risk Register Context:** Using the project's risk register (identified risks, mitigation plans) as context for prompts assessing the potential impact of changes or identifying new risks.
5.  **Stakeholder Information Context:** Including key stakeholder names, roles, and communication preferences as context for prompts generating status updates or communication plans.
6.  **Current Project Status Context:** Providing a summary of recent progress, current blockers, and upcoming tasks as context for prompts generating daily stand-up summaries or weekly reports.
7.  **Definition of Done/Process Context:** Including the team's agreed-upon Definition of Done or specific process steps (e.g., change management process) as context for prompts generating task checklists or validating process compliance.
8.  **Historical Project Data Context:** Utilizing data from past similar projects (e.g., effort estimations, common pitfalls) as context for prompts generating estimates or identifying potential risks for a new project/task.
9.  **Dependency Mapping Context:** Providing a map of inter-task or inter-team dependencies as context for prompts analyzing the ripple effects of delays or scope changes.
