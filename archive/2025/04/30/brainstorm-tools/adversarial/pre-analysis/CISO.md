# CISO - Pre-Analysis & Concepts

**Based on:** The strategic importance of securing AI systems, the need to manage risk associated with rapid development ("zero to sixty"), the formal Adversarial Testing Roadmap, and the potential business impact of AI failures.

**Goal:** Propose high-level strategies, governance frameworks, and risk management approaches for the organization's use of agentic AI, ensuring alignment with overall security posture, compliance requirements, and business objectives.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **AI Security Governance Framework:** Establish a formal governance framework for the development, deployment, and operation of AI agents. This includes defining roles and responsibilities (linking to PM's ADLC/Platform Team), setting mandatory security standards, establishing review/approval processes, and ensuring alignment with existing corporate security policies. *Leverages: Governance best practices, PM concepts.*
2.  **Risk Assessment Methodology for AI Initiatives:** Develop and mandate a standardized risk assessment methodology specifically for AI projects. This should evaluate risks related to data privacy, model security (bias, evasion, poisoning), tool integration, third-party dependencies, compliance (e.g., GDPR, AI Act), and potential misuse, integrating findings from the Adversarial Testing Roadmap. *Leverages: Risk management frameworks, compliance.*
3.  **AI Incident Response Plan:** Create a dedicated addendum to the corporate incident response plan detailing procedures for handling security incidents involving AI agents. This includes identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-mortem analysis, considering AI-specific challenges like model rollback, data decontamination, and prompt analysis. *Leverages: Incident response planning.*
4.  **Mandatory AI Security Training for Developers & Users:** Implement mandatory training programs covering secure AI development practices (based on the ADLC/SDK), responsible AI usage, common threats (prompt injection, social engineering via agents), and awareness of the Adversarial Testing program's goals and findings. *Leverages: Security awareness training.*
5.  **Third-Party AI Risk Management (TPRM) Program:** Establish procedures for assessing and managing the risks associated with using third-party AI models, platforms, or agent components. This includes vendor security assessments, contractual requirements for security and data handling, and monitoring for vulnerabilities in the supply chain. *Leverages: TPRM best practices.*
6.  **Ethical AI & Bias Review Board/Process:** Institute a process or board responsible for reviewing AI agent designs and outputs for potential ethical concerns, fairness issues, and unintended biases, working alongside security and product teams. Findings should feed back into development and testing. *Leverages: Responsible AI principles.*
7.  **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) for AI Security Posture:** Define and track specific KRIs to provide ongoing visibility into the security posture of deployed AI systems. Examples: Critical findings from Adversarial Benchmarks, number of policy overrides, rate of successful prompt injections in monitoring, time-to-patch AI dependencies, results of TPRM assessments. Report these KRIs to executive leadership. *Leverages: Security metrics, reporting.*
