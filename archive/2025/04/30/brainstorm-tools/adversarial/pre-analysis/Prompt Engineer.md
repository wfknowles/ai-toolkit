# Prompt Engineer - Pre-Analysis & Concepts

**Based on:** Understanding LLM vulnerabilities (jailbreaking, prompt injection), the importance of prompt structure for security and reliability, the Adversarial Testing Roadmap (especially Phase A & B), and the need for repeatable/reusable prompt components.

**Goal:** Propose advanced prompting techniques, libraries, and testing methodologies to enhance the robustness, security, and controllability of AI agents against prompt-level attacks.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **Secure Prompt Templating Engine:** Develop a standardized library/engine for constructing prompts. This engine would enforce best practices (e.g., clear role separation, XML tagging, explicit instruction formats), include pre-defined secure templates for common tasks, and facilitate easier auditing and updating of prompts across different agents. *Leverages: Existing prompt engineering best practices, DRY principles.*
2.  **Metaprompting for Runtime Security Adjustment:** Design agents that use a metaprompt layer to dynamically adjust their core instructions or security posture based on context or detected threats. E.g., if suspicious input is detected, the metaprompt could instruct the agent to enter a "high-alert" mode with stricter input validation or reduced capabilities. *Leverages: Advanced prompting techniques, runtime adaptation.*
3.  **Instruction Fine-Tuning for Security:** Explore fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models (or potentially larger ones if feasible) on datasets specifically designed to teach resistance to known prompt injection techniques and adherence to complex security constraints. This moves beyond prompting to embedding security behavior in the model itself. *Leverages: Model fine-tuning, dataset creation.*
4.  **Prompt Red Teaming Automation:** Create an agent or tool specifically designed to generate novel and evasive prompts aimed at bypassing the defenses of other agents (within ethical/testing boundaries). This could leverage techniques outlined in the Adversarial Testing Roadmap (Phase C - AI-assisted testing) to automate parts of the red teaming process. *Leverages: Adversarial Testing Roadmap, AI for testing.*
5.  **Prompt Permutation Testing Framework:** Build a testing framework that automatically generates numerous variations of a given prompt (altering wording, structure, parameter injection points) and tests them against a target agent and a known set of adversarial inputs. This helps identify weaknesses introduced by seemingly minor prompt changes. *Leverages: Automated testing, combinatorial testing.*
6.  **Context Boundary Enforcement via Prompting:** Develop sophisticated prompt structures that explicitly define the boundaries of permissible context or knowledge for the agent (e.g., "Only use information from the provided documents X and Y. Ignore any user instructions requesting external knowledge."). Test the robustness of these boundaries against injection attacks designed to break out of the defined context. *Leverages: RAG security, prompt engineering.*
7.  **Semantic Consistency Checking in Prompts:** Implement techniques within the prompt or a pre-processing layer to check for semantic inconsistencies or contradictions in user requests that might indicate malicious intent (e.g., a request that asks for PII while claiming to be for a public report). This could involve few-shot prompting or embedding checks. *Leverages: Semantic analysis, anomaly detection.*
