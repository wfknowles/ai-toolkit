# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis & Concepts

**Based on:** Understanding user needs, business goals, market trends, the value proposition of AI agents, and the importance of trust and safety for adoption. Balancing feature velocity with security and robustness (informed by Adversarial Testing Roadmap).

**Goal:** Propose product strategies, feature concepts, and prioritization frameworks that leverage agentic capabilities effectively while ensuring user trust, safety, and alignment with business objectives.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **"Agent Trust Center" Feature:** Develop an in-product feature or dedicated page explaining the agent's capabilities, limitations, data usage policies (linking to CISO governance), security measures (mentioning adversarial testing), and how users can report issues or provide feedback. This builds transparency and user trust. *Leverages: User trust initiatives, transparency.*
2.  **Configurable Agent "Guardrails" for Users/Admins:** Allow users or administrators to configure specific safety parameters or "guardrails" for agent behavior (e.g., disallow certain topics, restrict tool usage, set tone preferences, enable/disable specific knowledge sources for RAG). This gives users control and accommodates different risk tolerances. *Leverages: User customization, safety features.*
3.  **Proactive Agent Assistance with Security Tasks:** Develop agent capabilities specifically designed to *assist* users with security-related tasks, such as identifying potential phishing emails, summarizing security reports, explaining complex compliance requirements in plain language, or guiding users through security best practices. Turns the agent into a security ally. *Leverages: AI for security assistance.*
4.  **Gradual Rollout & Feature Flagging Strategy for Agent Capabilities:** Implement a robust feature flagging system and adopt a gradual rollout strategy (e.g., internal alpha, beta program, percentage-based rollout) for new agent features or significant changes. This allows for monitoring impact, gathering feedback, and quickly disabling features if unexpected security issues arise (informed by Adversarial Testing). *Leverages: Feature flagging, phased rollouts.*
5.  **User Feedback Loop for Adversarial Discovery:** Create mechanisms for users to easily report instances where the agent behaved unexpectedly, produced harmful/biased output, or seemed to misunderstand instructions. Tag this feedback specifically for review by the security/prompt engineering teams to identify potential new adversarial attack vectors or prompt weaknesses. *Leverages: User feedback systems, continuous improvement.*
6.  **Agent Specialization Strategy:** Instead of building one monolithic agent, focus on developing multiple, specialized agents optimized for specific tasks or domains (e.g., a code generation agent, a customer support agent, a data analysis agent). This can limit the potential impact of a compromise (blast radius reduction) and allow for domain-specific tuning and security controls. *Leverages: Product strategy, micro-agent concept.*
7.  **Prioritization Framework Integrating Security Risk:** Adapt the product backlog prioritization framework (e.g., RICE, MoSCoW) to explicitly include security risk as a key factor. Findings from the Adversarial Testing Roadmap and CISO KRIs should directly influence feature priority, ensuring that critical security hardening work isn't consistently deprioritized for new features. *Leverages: Agile methodologies, risk management.*
