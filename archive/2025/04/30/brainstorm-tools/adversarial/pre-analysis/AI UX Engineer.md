# AI UX Engineer - Pre-Analysis & Concepts

**Based on:** Understanding human-computer interaction, user-centered design principles, usability testing, interaction design for conversational AI, and the importance of user trust and managing expectations with AI capabilities (potentially fallible, subject to attacks shown in Adversarial Testing).

**Goal:** Propose user interface designs, interaction patterns, and feedback mechanisms that make AI agents intuitive, trustworthy, and safe to use, while effectively communicating their capabilities and limitations.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **Transparency in Agent Reasoning (Explainability UI):** Design UI elements that provide users with insight into *why* the agent generated a particular response or took a specific action. This could involve showing sources used (for RAG), tools invoked, confidence scores, or simplified explanations of the reasoning process. This builds trust and aids debugging. *Leverages: Explainable AI (XAI) concepts, UI design.*
2.  **Clear Indication of Agent vs. Human Interaction:** Ensure the UI always makes it unambiguously clear when the user is interacting with an AI agent versus a human (in hybrid scenarios). Avoid designs that intentionally blur this line, which can erode trust and enable social engineering. *Leverages: Ethical design principles, UI patterns.*
3.  **Graceful Handling of Uncertainty & Failure:** Design interaction patterns for how the agent communicates uncertainty, inability to fulfill a request, or errors (including security-related blocks from the Architect's service). Avoid overly confident responses when unsure; provide helpful error messages and potential next steps. *Leverages: Conversational design, error handling.*
4.  **User Control over Agent Actions (Confirmation Steps):** For actions with significant consequences (e.g., sending emails, modifying data, executing sensitive tool commands), implement explicit confirmation steps in the UI where the user must approve the agent's proposed action. *Leverages: Safety patterns, interaction design.*
5.  **Visualizing Agent State & Progress:** For multi-step tasks or long-running agent processes, provide UI feedback indicating the current state, progress, and what the agent is currently working on. This manages user expectations and avoids the perception of the agent being "stuck" or unresponsive. *Leverages: Progress indicators, state visualization.*
6.  **In-UI Security Guidance & Warnings:** Integrate contextual security tips or warnings directly into the UI. For example, if a user prompt seems to request sensitive information, the UI could display a subtle warning about sharing PII. Link to the PO's "Agent Trust Center" for more details. *Leverages: Contextual help, security awareness.*
7.  **Usability Testing with Adversarial Scenarios:** Incorporate specific tasks into usability testing protocols where users are asked to (or inadvertently) interact with the agent in ways that might trigger adversarial behaviors (based on findings from Adversarial Testing). Observe user reactions, confusion, and ability to recognize/recover from unexpected agent responses. Use findings to improve UI clarity and safety features. *Leverages: Usability testing methodologies.*
