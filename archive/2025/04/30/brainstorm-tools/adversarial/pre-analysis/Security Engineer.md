# Security Engineer - Pre-Analysis & Concepts

**Based on:** Expertise in application security, threat modeling, penetration testing, secure infrastructure design, security monitoring, and vulnerability management. Applying traditional security principles to the novel challenges of AI agents and the specific areas highlighted in the Adversarial Testing Roadmap.

**Goal:** Propose specific technical security controls, testing strategies, and monitoring techniques to harden the agentic framework against known and emerging threats, focusing on practical implementation and integration with existing security tooling.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **Threat Modeling for Agent Workflows:** Conduct detailed threat modeling exercises (e.g., using STRIDE) specifically for common agent workflows (RAG, tool usage, planning). Identify potential threats, attack vectors, and failure modes at each stage (user input -> prompt construction -> LLM -> tool -> output). Use findings to prioritize security controls and Adversarial Testing scenarios. *Leverages: Threat modeling methodologies (STRIDE).*
2.  **Input Filtering & Output Encoding Implementation:** Design and implement robust input filtering mechanisms (going beyond basic sanitization suggested by SSE) to detect and block known prompt injection patterns, malicious payloads targeting tools, and attempts at context manipulation. Implement strict output encoding for agent responses displayed in UIs to prevent XSS injected via LLM responses. *Leverages: Web security (Input validation, XSS prevention).*
3.  **Tool Access Control & Least Privilege:** Implement fine-grained access controls for agent tools based on the principle of least privilege. Agents should only have access to the specific tools and permissions required for their intended function. Investigate mechanisms like dynamic scope reduction or capability-based security for tool interactions, integrating with SSE's SDK. *Leverages: Access control models (RBAC, ABAC), principle of least privilege.*
4.  **Infrastructure Security Hardening for AI Components:** Define and enforce security hardening standards for all infrastructure components supporting the agentic framework (VMs, containers, serverless functions, databases, vector stores). This includes secure base images, network segmentation, secrets management, and regular vulnerability scanning/patching (linking to SSE's dependency scanning). *Leverages: Infrastructure security, CIS benchmarks.*
5.  **Security Logging & Alerting Pipeline:** Define comprehensive security logging requirements for all agent components. Ensure logs capture relevant events (authentication, authorization, tool calls, policy violations, errors). Forward logs to a central SIEM system and develop specific detection rules and alerts for suspicious activities identified during threat modeling or Adversarial Testing (e.g., repeated failed tool calls, anomalous prompt patterns). *Leverages: SIEM, security logging best practices, detection engineering.*
6.  **Automated Security Testing in CI/CD:** Integrate various automated security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline: SAST (as per SSE), DAST (dynamic analysis targeting deployed agent APIs/interfaces), IAST (interactive analysis), and potentially specialized AI security scanners if available. Correlate findings with Adversarial Testing results. *Leverages: DevSecOps, application security testing tools.*
7.  **Internal Red Team Engagements (Focused):** Plan and execute periodic, focused red team engagements specifically targeting the deployed AI agents, simulating attacker TTPs relevant to AI systems (prompt injection, tool exploitation, RAG poisoning, model evasion). Use the formal process defined in the Adversarial Testing Roadmap (Phase C) and feed findings back into defenses and future testing. *Leverages: Penetration testing, red teaming.*
