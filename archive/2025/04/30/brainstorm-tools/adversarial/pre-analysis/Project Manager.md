# Project Manager - Pre-Analysis & Concepts

**Based on:** Experience managing software projects, understanding SDLC/Agile methodologies, resource planning, risk management (schedule, budget, scope), and the need to integrate new processes (like Adversarial Testing) into existing workflows.

**Goal:** Propose project management frameworks, processes, and organizational structures to efficiently and effectively deliver secure and robust AI agent capabilities, ensuring alignment across teams and clear communication.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC):** Define and document a specific lifecycle for agent development, adapting the standard SDLC to include AI-specific phases like data sourcing/curation, model selection/tuning, prompt engineering, specialized testing (including Adversarial Testing phases from the roadmap), and ongoing monitoring/retraining. *Leverages: SDLC models, process definition.*
2.  **Cross-Functional AI Platform Team:** Propose the formation of a dedicated platform team responsible for building and maintaining the core agent infrastructure, shared tools, security services (like the Architect's monitoring service), and the Secure Tool SDK (from SSE). This team supports multiple product-focused agent teams, ensuring consistency and reuse. *Leverages: Platform engineering concepts, team topologies.*
3.  **Integrating Adversarial Testing into Sprints:** Develop clear processes for incorporating Adversarial Testing activities (manual testing, benchmark runs, finding remediation) into the regular sprint cycle. Define Definition of Done criteria that include passing relevant security checks/benchmarks. Allocate capacity for these activities during sprint planning. *Leverages: Agile/Scrum practices, Adversarial Testing Roadmap.*
4.  **AI Project Risk Register Template:** Create a standardized risk register template specifically for AI projects, pre-populated with common AI risks (model bias, data drift, prompt injection, tool exploits, ethical concerns, regulatory changes) and linked to mitigation strategies (e.g., specific Adversarial Testing phases, CISO's governance framework). *Leverages: Risk management, project planning.*
5.  **Milestone-Based Funding/Gating for AI Initiatives:** Structure larger AI initiatives with clear milestones tied to demonstrating specific capabilities and security assurances (e.g., passing Adversarial Benchmark V1.0). Use these milestones as gates for further funding or wider rollout decisions, aligning with the phased approach of the Adversarial Testing Roadmap. *Leverages: Phase-gate models, program management.*
6.  **Communication Plan for AI Security Findings:** Establish a formal communication plan for disseminating findings from Adversarial Testing and security reviews to relevant stakeholders (developers, product owners, leadership, potentially users via PO's Trust Center). Define reporting frequency, format, and escalation paths for critical issues. *Leverages: Stakeholder management, communication planning.*
7.  **Skills Matrix & Training Plan for AI Teams:** Develop a skills matrix identifying the necessary competencies for team members working on AI agents (prompt engineering, LLM operations, data science, security testing, specific tool domains). Identify gaps and create a training plan (linking to CISO's training) to upskill the workforce. *Leverages: Resource management, training development.*
