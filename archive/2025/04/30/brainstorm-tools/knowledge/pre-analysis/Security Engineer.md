# Security Engineer - Pre-Analysis & Concepts (Knowledge Leverage)

**Based on:** Expertise in data security, access control, secure data pipelines, vulnerability management for data stores, and threat modeling specific to information retrieval systems.

**Goal:** Propose specific technical controls and testing strategies to secure the knowledge base itself and the agent's interaction with it, preventing unauthorized access, data leakage, or manipulation.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **Vector Database Security Hardening:** Implement specific security controls for the chosen vector database(s) (ARCH-6). This includes network isolation, authentication/authorization, encryption at rest/transit, vulnerability scanning of the DB software, and minimizing its attack surface. *Leverages: Database security, infrastructure hardening.*
2.  **Fine-Grained Access Control Implementation for KB:** Design and implement the technical mechanisms to enforce the KB Access Control Policy (CISO-1). This could involve using database-level controls, middleware checks within the KB API Layer (ARCH-7), or embedding access logic within the retrieval process based on user/agent identity and document metadata. *Leverages: Access control implementation (RBAC/ABAC).*
3.  **Testing for KB Access Control Bypass:** Develop specific test cases (manual and potentially automated) aimed at bypassing the KB access controls (SE-2). Attempt to retrieve documents the agent/user shouldn't have access to via crafted queries or manipulating metadata filters. *Leverages: Security testing, penetration testing.*
4.  **Data Poisoning Detection/Mitigation for KB:** Research and potentially implement mechanisms to detect or mitigate data poisoning attacks targeting the KB. This could involve validating data sources during ingestion (CISO-4), anomaly detection on embeddings, or techniques to identify/isolate suspicious data during retrieval. *Leverages: AI security, data validation, anomaly detection.*
5.  **Secure Metadata Handling:** Ensure that metadata used for access control (e.g., sensitivity labels - CISO-1, SSE-4) or filtering (PE-6) is handled securely throughout the ingestion (ARCH-5) and retrieval pipeline, preventing tampering or manipulation that could lead to unauthorized access. *Leverages: Data integrity, secure coding.*
6.  **Rate Limiting & Query Complexity Limits for KB API:** Implement rate limiting and query complexity limits on the Knowledge Base API (ARCH-7) to prevent denial-of-service attacks or resource exhaustion caused by overly broad or complex queries from agents or users. *Leverages: DoS prevention, API security.*
7.  **Differential Privacy for KB Analytics:** If collecting analytics on KB usage (CISO-5, PO-7, PM-5), explore applying differential privacy techniques to protect the privacy of user queries and accessed documents, especially if analyzing sensitive topics. *Leverages: Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), differential privacy.*
