# AI UX Engineer - Pre-Analysis & Concepts (Knowledge Leverage)

**Based on:** Understanding user information needs, cognitive load, interaction design for search and information retrieval, visualizing complex information, and building trust in AI-provided knowledge.

**Goal:** Propose UI/UX designs and interaction patterns that allow users to effectively access, understand, verify, and interact with knowledge retrieved by the AI agent from the knowledge base.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **Source Attribution & Verification UI:** Design clear UI elements to display the source(s) of information retrieved from the KB (as prompted by PE-3). Allow users to easily click through to view the original document or chunk for verification. Indicate confidence scores or potential conflicts (PE-5) visually. *Leverages: Explainable AI (XAI), information visualization, user trust.*
2.  **Mixed-Initiative Knowledge Exploration:** Design interactions where the user and agent collaboratively explore the KB. Allow users to refine searches, ask follow-up questions based on retrieved context, and guide the agent's information synthesis process, rather than just receiving a final answer. *Leverages: Conversational search, interactive systems.*
3.  **Visualizing KB Connections:** Explore UI designs that visualize relationships between different pieces of knowledge within the KB (especially if using ARCH-1 hybrid model). This could be a graph visualization or linked snippets, helping users understand context and discover related information. *Leverages: Information visualization, knowledge graphs.*
4.  **Feedback Mechanisms for KB Accuracy/Relevance:** Integrate simple UI elements allowing users to rate the relevance or accuracy of information retrieved from the KB for a given query. This feedback loop (linking to PO-5) can be used to improve retrieval algorithms or identify content needing review (PM-1, CISO-3). *Leverages: User feedback systems, continuous improvement.*
5.  **Personalized KB Views/Summaries:** Design interfaces that potentially tailor the presentation or summarization of KB information (PO-3) based on the user's role, expertise level, or past interactions (respecting CISO-1 access controls and potentially CISO-6 redaction). *Leverages: Personalization, adaptive interfaces.*
6.  **Seamless Integration of KB Access:** Design the UI so that accessing KB information feels like a natural part of the agent's conversation or the user's workflow (PO-2), rather than a separate, explicit search function. Minimize friction in getting knowledge when needed. *Leverages: Contextual computing, workflow integration.*
7.  **Handling "I Don't Know" from KB:** Design clear and helpful ways for the agent to communicate when relevant information *cannot* be found in the KB for a user's query. Avoid hallucination; potentially suggest alternative search strategies or offer to route the query to a human expert or KB contribution workflow (PO-6). *Leverages: Error handling, conversational design.*
