# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis & Concepts (Knowledge Leverage)

**Based on:** Understanding user workflows, identifying pain points solvable by better information access, defining the value proposition of a knowledge-enhanced AI agent, and prioritizing features that deliver tangible benefits from the KB.

**Goal:** Propose product features, use cases, and strategies that leverage the knowledge base to create significant value for users and the business.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **AI-Powered Onboarding Assistant:** Utilize the KB (containing product docs, tutorials, best practices) to create an agent that guides new users through onboarding processes, answers their setup questions, and points them to relevant documentation contextually. *Leverages: KB for user support, conversational learning.*
2.  **Contextual Help & Troubleshooting Agent:** Develop an agent feature where users can ask questions *within their current workflow* (e.g., about a specific UI element or error message), and the agent uses the KB (containing FAQs, troubleshooting guides, technical docs) to provide relevant answers and solutions without context switching. *Leverages: KB for contextual support, in-app help.*
3.  **Automated Documentation Summarization:** Leverage the KB and agent summarization capabilities (PE-2) to provide users with concise summaries of long documents or sets of documents within the KB, tailored to their query or role. *Leverages: Summarization, information distillation.*
4.  **Proactive Knowledge Surfacing:** Design agent capabilities that proactively surface relevant information from the KB based on the user's current context or task, even without an explicit query. E.g., suggesting relevant API documentation while the user is writing code, or surfacing a related policy document while they draft an email. *Leverages: Context awareness, proactive assistance.*
5.  **"Ask the KB" Enterprise Search Feature:** Position the agent as a superior natural language interface for searching across diverse enterprise knowledge sources unified in the KB (potentially federated via ARCH-2). Go beyond simple keyword search to understand intent and synthesize answers. *Leverages: Natural language search, enterprise search.*
6.  **KB Contribution Workflow via Agent:** Create a workflow where users can easily contribute knowledge (e.g., documenting a solution, sharing best practices) *through* an AI agent. The agent could help structure the information, suggest tags/metadata (SSE-4), and route it through the secure ingestion pipeline (CISO-4, ARCH-5). *Leverages: Knowledge creation, user contribution.*
7.  **Measuring KB Impact on Business Metrics:** Define and track metrics demonstrating the value derived from the KB via agent interactions. Examples: Reduction in support ticket volume (Concept 1, 2), faster task completion times, improved compliance adherence (via proactive surfacing), usage rates of KB-powered features. *Leverages: Product analytics, value measurement.*
