# CISO - Pre-Analysis & Concepts (Knowledge Leverage)

**Based on:** The need for secure and compliant handling of organizational knowledge, risks associated with inaccurate or inappropriate knowledge retrieval by AI, data governance requirements, and the potential for the knowledge base (KB) to contain sensitive information.

**Goal:** Propose strategies and controls for governing the AI's access to and use of the organizational knowledge base, ensuring security, compliance, and appropriate information handling.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **KB Access Control Policy:** Define a clear policy governing which agents, users, or roles can access specific sections or types of information within the knowledge base. This includes defining sensitivity levels for knowledge documents and mapping them to access roles. Implement technical controls to enforce this policy (linking to SE concepts). *Leverages: Access control principles, data classification.*
2.  **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for KB Retrieval:** Implement or integrate DLP mechanisms that scan information retrieved from the KB by the agent *before* it is presented to the user or used in further actions. Block or redact sensitive information (PII, confidential project names, financial data) based on defined policies. *Leverages: DLP technologies, data security.*
3.  **KB Content Auditing & Review Process:** Establish a regular process for auditing the content within the knowledge base for accuracy, appropriateness, and compliance with data retention policies. Define responsibilities for content review and updates, potentially involving original content owners or SMEs. *Leverages: Audit processes, data governance.*
4.  **Secure Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline:** Define security requirements for the process of adding new information to the KB (as outlined in the Knowledge Acquisition Roadmap). This includes checks for malware in ingested documents, validation of data sources, and ensuring appropriate metadata (like sensitivity level, owner, retention date) is applied during ingestion. *Leverages: Secure data handling, pipeline security.*
5.  **Knowledge Base Usage Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement monitoring to track how the KB is being accessed and used by AI agents. Generate alerts for anomalous access patterns (e.g., an agent unexpectedly accessing highly sensitive data, excessive data retrieval) or policy violations detected by DLP or access controls. Integrate with SE's logging/alerting pipeline. *Leverages: Security monitoring, anomaly detection.*
6.  **Role-Based Redaction/Summarization:** Explore techniques where the agent redacts or summarizes information retrieved from the KB based on the *requesting user's role or permissions*. A senior manager might get full details, while a junior employee gets a redacted or high-level summary of the same document. This requires tight integration between KB access control and agent response generation. *Leverages: Access control, dynamic content generation.*
7.  **Compliance Reporting from KB Usage:** Develop capabilities to generate reports demonstrating compliance with data access and usage policies based on the KB monitoring logs. This could be crucial for internal audits or external regulatory requirements. *Leverages: Compliance reporting, log analysis.*
