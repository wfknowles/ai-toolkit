# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis & Concepts (Knowledge Leverage)

**Based on:** Experience implementing data-intensive applications, working with databases (SQL, NoSQL, vector), API development, data processing libraries, and writing efficient/maintainable code for data pipelines and retrieval systems.

**Goal:** Propose concrete implementation details, libraries, code patterns, and developer tooling for interacting with and managing the knowledge base effectively.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **KB Client Library/SDK:** Develop a dedicated client library (e.g., Python package) for agent developers to interact with the Knowledge Base API Abstraction Layer (ARCH-7). This library would handle connection management, query construction, result parsing, and potentially integrate with the caching layer (ARCH-4). *Leverages: SDK development, API client design.*
2.  **Document Processing & Chunking Utilities:** Create a reusable library of robust document processing utilities based on the Knowledge Roadmap (Phase 2). Include functions for loading various file types (code, markdown, PDF), implementing different chunking strategies (recursive, semantic), and extracting/validating metadata consistently. *Leverages: Data processing libraries (e.g., Unstructured, LlamaIndex), code reuse.*
3.  **Embedding Generation & Management Service:** Implement a service or set of utilities responsible for generating text embeddings consistently using the chosen models (Knowledge Roadmap Phase 2). Handle batching, potential retries, and storage/association of embeddings with their corresponding text chunks. *Leverages: ML model inference (e.g., SentenceTransformers), microservices.*
4.  **Metadata Schema Definition & Validation:** Define a strict schema for the metadata associated with KB documents and chunks (source, timestamp, owner, sensitivity - CISO-1, etc.). Implement validation logic within the ingestion pipeline (ARCH-5) and retrieval API (ARCH-7) to ensure metadata consistency. *Leverages: Data modeling, schema validation (e.g., Pydantic).*
5.  **Integration Testing Framework for RAG:** Develop an integration testing framework specifically for the RAG pipeline. Define test cases with sample queries and expected relevant document chunks, allowing automated verification that changes to embedding models, chunking strategies, or vector DB configuration don't break core retrieval functionality. *Leverages: Integration testing, test automation.*
6.  **Data Migration Utilities for KB:** Build tools and scripts to handle potential data migrations within the KB ecosystem, such as re-embedding all documents with a new model, changing chunking strategies, or migrating between different vector database technologies. *Leverages: Database migration tools, scripting.*
7.  **Developer Sandbox/Tool for KB Interaction:** Create a simple tool or sandbox environment (e.g., a CLI command, a simple web UI) that allows developers to directly query the KB (via ARCH-7), inspect retrieved chunks and metadata, and test different query formulations or embedding strategies during development. *Leverages: Developer tooling, CLI tools.*
