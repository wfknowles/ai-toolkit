# Prompt Engineer - Pre-Analysis & Concepts (Knowledge Leverage)

**Based on:** Understanding how LLMs interact with provided context (RAG), the importance of formatting context for optimal retrieval and reasoning, techniques for instructing models on how to use knowledge, and mitigating risks like hallucination or context manipulation.

**Goal:** Propose prompting strategies and techniques to maximize the effective and secure utilization of knowledge base content by AI agents.

**Initial Concepts (7):**

1.  **Context-Rich Prompt Formatting:** Design prompt templates specifically optimized for RAG. This includes clear delimiters for retrieved KB context, instructions on how to prioritize KB information versus parametric knowledge, and guidance on citing sources from the KB in the response. *Leverages: RAG best practices, prompt engineering.*
2.  **Instruction Tuning for Faithful Summarization/Synthesis:** Fine-tune models (or use prompt techniques like few-shot examples) specifically on the task of accurately summarizing or synthesizing information *only* from the provided KB context, minimizing hallucination or reliance on external knowledge when using the KB. *Leverages: Fine-tuning, instruction following, RAG faithfulness.*
3.  **Prompting for Source Attribution:** Develop reliable prompt structures that compel the agent to attribute its answers by citing the specific document(s) or chunk(s) from the KB used to generate the response. This increases transparency and allows users to verify information (linking to UXE concepts). *Leverages: Explainable AI (XAI), prompt engineering.*
4.  **Query Transformation/Refinement Prompts:** Implement a prompt-based step where the agent refines or transforms the user's raw query into an optimized query specifically for the KB vector search. This could involve adding keywords, rephrasing, or generating multiple query variations based on the user's intent. *Leverages: Query expansion, search optimization.*
5.  **Handling Conflicting Information Prompts:** Create prompt strategies for how the agent should handle conflicting information retrieved from different KB sources or between the KB and its parametric knowledge. Options include highlighting the conflict, asking for clarification, or prioritizing based on predefined source reliability scores. *Leverages: Conflict resolution, critical reasoning via prompting.*
6.  **Metadata-Aware Prompting:** Design prompts that leverage the metadata associated with KB chunks (e.g., document source, creation date, sensitivity level from CISO-1). Instruct the agent to consider this metadata when synthesizing answers (e.g., "Prioritize information from official policy documents created in the last year"). *Leverages: Metadata utilization, advanced RAG.*
7.  **Prompt-Based KB Security Checks:** Use prompts to perform lightweight security checks on retrieved KB content *before* incorporating it into the final response context for the main LLM call. For example, a smaller, faster model could be prompted to check if a retrieved chunk seems to contain obvious PII or violates a specific content policy, adding a layer before DLP (CISO-2). *Leverages: Multi-step prompting, lightweight security checks.*
