# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial Persona Usage Concepts

Focusing on orchestrating persona-driven workflows and systems:

1.  **Persona-Based Agent Routing:** An orchestrator that routes incoming requests to specialized AI agents based on the required expertise, effectively assigning the task to the agent with the right "persona".
2.  **Orchestrated Multi-Persona Review:** A workflow where a piece of work (e.g., code, documentation, design) is sequentially reviewed by different AI personas (e.g., Security Engineer persona, then Performance Engineer persona, then UX persona), with feedback collated by the orchestrator.
3.  **Persona-Aware Tool Selection:** The orchestrator considers the assigned persona when deciding which tools or APIs an agent should use (e.g., a "CISO" persona might prioritize security scanning tools, while an "SRE" persona might prioritize monitoring tools).
4.  **Dynamic Persona Instantiation:** Architecting a system where personas can be dynamically loaded or configured based on the task requirements, rather than having statically defined agents.
5.  **Persona Context Management:** Designing how persona definitions themselves are stored, managed, versioned, and injected into prompts or agent configurations by the orchestration layer.
6.  **Persona Capability Mapping:** Maintaining a mapping between defined personas and their associated capabilities, knowledge domains, or access permissions within the system architecture.
7.  **Cross-Persona Knowledge Synthesis:** An orchestration pattern where insights generated by different personas working on related tasks are synthesized into a holistic view (e.g., combining security findings with performance analysis).
8.  **Persona-Driven Workflow Adaptation:** Designing workflows that dynamically change their path or steps based on the findings or recommendations of an AI persona operating within the workflow.
9.  **Persona Performance Monitoring:** Architecting mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness and consistency of different AI personas in fulfilling their designated roles within orchestrated tasks.
