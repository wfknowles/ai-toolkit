# Senior Software Engineer - Initial Persona Usage Concepts

Focusing on leveraging personas for technical tasks during maintenance:

1.  **"Expert System" Personas:** Defining highly specialized technical personas (e.g., "PostgreSQL Tuning Expert", "Kubernetes Networking Specialist", "Legacy COBOL Maintainer") to get targeted advice or code suggestions for specific domains.
2.  **Persona for Code Review Simulation:** Using an AI persona (e.g., "Strict Security Reviewer", "Performance Optimization Expert") to perform a preliminary automated code review on a developer's changes before submitting for human review.
3.  **Debugging Assistant Persona:** Invoking a "Systematic Debugger" persona that asks clarifying questions and suggests debugging steps methodically based on provided error messages and code context.
4.  **Cross-Skilling Simulation Persona:** Using a persona representing a different engineering role (e.g., "QA Engineer", "SRE") to help a developer anticipate concerns or requirements from that perspective (e.g., "How would a QA engineer test this change?").
5.  **Technical Documentation Persona:** Assigning a "Technical Writer" persona to generate documentation drafts (e.g., README updates, API docs) based on code changes, adopting the appropriate tone and structure.
6.  **"Rubber Duck" Persona:** A simple persona designed to act as a sounding board, where the developer explains a problem, and the AI (as the persona) asks basic questions or rephrases the problem to aid the developer's own thinking.
7.  **Legacy Code Explanation Persona:** Employing a persona like "Software Archaeologist" specifically trained or prompted to analyze and explain obscure or poorly documented legacy code sections.
8.  **Test Case Generation Persona:** Using a "Creative QA Tester" persona to brainstorm edge cases and non-obvious test scenarios beyond standard functional testing.
9.  **Architectural Design Review Persona:** Utilizing an "Experienced Software Architect" persona to provide feedback on the design implications or potential architectural impacts of a proposed code change during maintenance.
