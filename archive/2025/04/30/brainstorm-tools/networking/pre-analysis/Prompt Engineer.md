# Prompt Engineer - Initial Concepts on AI in Networking

Focusing on natural language interaction for network management and troubleshooting:

1.  **Natural Language Network Diagnostics:** Prompts allowing users to describe network problems in plain language (e.g., "My laptop Wi-Fi is slow in the bedroom," "The smart TV keeps buffering"), which the AI translates into diagnostic queries or troubleshooting steps (Ther #2, Psych #1).
2.  **Intent-Based Configuration Prompts:** Allow users to state configuration goals (e.g., "Prioritize video calls for my work laptop," "Block my kid's tablet after 9 PM," "Open port 80 for my web server") and have the AI translate these into specific router/firewall rules (Psych #3).
3.  **Contextual Explanation Prompts:** Design prompts that enable AI to explain network concepts (Psych #5), diagnostic results, or security alerts clearly and concisely, adapting the level of technical detail based on user profile or explicit requests.
4.  **Comparative Prompts for Public Wi-Fi:** Prompts to assess public Wi-Fi options, e.g., "Compare the speed and security of networks X and Y," based on available data or historical performance (requires data source).
5.  **Security Configuration Guidance Prompts:** Prompts that guide users through securing their home network, explaining options like WPA3, guest networks, and firewall settings in understandable terms.
6.  **IoT Device Management Prompts:** Natural language prompts for managing IoT devices on the network (e.g., "Show all cameras online," "Check security settings for the smart lock," "Is the thermostat using the latest firmware?") (Ther #5).
7.  **Bandwidth Usage Query Prompts:** Allow users to ask questions like "What device used the most data yesterday?" or "Why is my upload speed low right now?" with the AI translating these into queries against network monitoring data.
8.  **Prompt Chaining for Complex Troubleshooting:** Design prompt sequences that guide users through multi-step troubleshooting, remembering context from previous steps (e.g., "Okay, ping was successful. Now let's check DNS...").
9.  **Filtering/Summarization Prompts for Network Logs:** Prompts to query and summarize verbose network logs, e.g., "Show me all blocked connection attempts in the last hour," "Summarize critical errors from the router log."
