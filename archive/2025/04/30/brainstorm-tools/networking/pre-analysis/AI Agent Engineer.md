# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Concepts on AI in Networking

Focusing on developing autonomous agents for network tasks:

1.  **Troubleshooting Agent:** An agent that can ingest user problem descriptions (PE #1), automatically run diagnostics (ping, traceroute, DNS checks, speed tests, device status checks), analyze results, identify likely root causes, and guide users through resolution steps (Psych #1, AI UX #5).
2.  **Network Optimization Agent:** An autonomous agent (running potentially at the edge - AOA #4) that continuously monitors network conditions (AOA #1) and proactively adjusts settings (Wi-Fi channels, QoS, beamforming) to maintain optimal performance and reliability.
3.  **Security Monitoring Agent:** An agent dedicated to monitoring network traffic for anomalies, detecting intrusion attempts, identifying vulnerable IoT devices, and alerting users or escalating to a central security system (SecEng #1, #2).
4.  **IoT Onboarding & Management Agent:** An agent that simplifies adding new IoT devices by automatically detecting them, guiding users through secure setup, assigning appropriate network policies (e.g., VLAN segmentation), and monitoring their behavior (Ther #5, AI UX #4).
5.  **Bandwidth Allocation Agent:** An agent implementing intelligent QoS logic (AOA #2), dynamically prioritizing traffic based on predefined rules, user requests (PE #2), or application type recognition.
6.  **Predictive Maintenance Agent:** An agent analyzing device logs and performance trends to predict potential hardware failures (e.g., failing router, degrading cable modem signal) and alert users proactively.
7.  **Public Wi-Fi Assessment Agent:** An agent (potentially mobile) that can assess the security posture, performance, and reliability of public Wi-Fi networks based on scans and potentially crowdsourced data (PE #4).
8.  **Multi-Agent Coordination for Network Management:** Design protocols for different agents (optimization, security, troubleshooting) to coordinate their actions and share relevant information without conflicting.
9.  **Explainable Agent Actions:** Ensure all agents can provide clear explanations for their automated actions or recommendations, fostering user trust and understanding (AI UX #3).
