# AI UX Engineer - Initial Concepts on AI in Networking

Focusing on designing intuitive, informative, and trustworthy user interfaces for AI-powered network management:

1.  **Simplified Network Dashboard:** Design a user-centric dashboard that uses AI to surface the most relevant information (overall status, connected devices, active issues, security alerts) clearly and concisely, avoiding overwhelming technical detail (Ther #2, Couns #3).
2.  **Visual Network Mapping:** Use AI to automatically discover devices and visualize the home network topology in an easy-to-understand map, showing connections, signal strength, and potential bottlenecks (Psych #6).
3.  **Transparent AI Actions & Explanations:** Design clear UI elements to explain *what* the AI is doing (e.g., "Optimizing Wi-Fi channel for less interference"), *why* it's doing it, and provide easy access to revert changes (Ther #7, Psych #7).
4.  **Intuitive IoT Device Management:** Design a simple, unified interface for onboarding, viewing status, managing security settings, and troubleshooting connectivity for diverse IoT devices on the network (Ther #5).
5.  **Contextual Troubleshooting Guidance:** Design interactive flows where AI guides users through troubleshooting steps (AAE #1), providing visual cues, asking clarifying questions, and explaining results simply.
6.  **User-Friendly QoS Configuration:** Design an interface that allows users to easily set Quality of Service priorities based on activities (gaming, streaming, video calls) or devices, abstracting away complex underlying rules (PE #2).
7.  **Clear Security & Privacy Controls:** Design unambiguous interfaces for managing security settings (guest networks, firewalls, content filtering) and understanding/controlling privacy aspects related to network monitoring (Ther #3, CISO #1).
8.  **Progressive Onboarding & Help:** Design an onboarding experience that introduces AI features gradually and provides contextual help and tutorials tailored to the user's apparent technical comfort level (Couns #1, Psych #8).
9.  **Accessible Design for All Users:** Ensure all interfaces rigorously adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG), catering to users with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments (Ther #8).
