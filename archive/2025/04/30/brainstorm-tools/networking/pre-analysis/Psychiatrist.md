# Psychiatrist - Initial Concepts on AI in Networking (Cognitive Load/Decision Making Perspective - Non-Implementer)

Focusing on cognitive load, attention, and decision-making related to network management:

1.  **Reducing Cognitive Load of Troubleshooting:** Network troubleshooting is often complex and requires systematic deduction. AI guiding users through logical troubleshooting steps (AAE #1) or automating diagnostics significantly reduces cognitive load, especially for non-experts.
2.  **Information Overload in Network Monitoring:** Raw network data (packet captures, logs) causes information overload. AI distilling this into concise, actionable insights (e.g., identifying the root cause of slowdowns) makes monitoring manageable (AI UX #2).
3.  **Decision Support for Configuration:** Configuring routers (QoS, port forwarding, security settings) involves many choices. AI providing context-aware recommendations or explaining the implications of different settings aids user decision-making.
4.  **Attention Management for Alerts:** Network alerts can be numerous and cryptic. AI filtering noise, prioritizing critical alerts, and explaining their significance helps users focus attention where it's needed (related to Wellness SecEng #6).
5.  **Simplifying Complex Network Concepts:** AI explaining concepts like IP addressing, subnets, DNS, or Wi-Fi channels in simple terms (PE #1) lowers the cognitive barrier to understanding and managing one's network.
6.  **Mental Models of Network Behavior:** Users have varying mental models of how networks function. AI visualizations (AI UX #5) or explanations tailored to different levels of understanding can help build more accurate mental models.
7.  **Automation Bias:** Users might overly trust AI recommendations for network configuration or troubleshooting (Ther #7). Interfaces should encourage critical assessment of AI suggestions where appropriate.
8.  **Cognitive Effort of Learning AI Tools:** While AI aims to simplify, learning to use the AI management tool itself requires cognitive effort. Intuitive design and clear onboarding are crucial (AI UX #8, Couns #1).
9.  **Impact of Latency/Performance on Cognition:** Network latency and poor performance directly impact cognitive tasks requiring responsiveness (video calls, online gaming, remote desktops). AI optimizing for low latency (AOA #1) has cognitive benefits beyond just speed.
