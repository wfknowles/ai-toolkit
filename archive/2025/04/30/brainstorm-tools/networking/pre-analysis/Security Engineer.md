# Security Engineer - Initial Concepts on AI in Networking

Focusing on securing home and public networks using AI:

1.  **AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS):** Use AI models trained on vast datasets of benign and malicious traffic to detect novel threats, zero-day attacks, and anomalous behavior on home or public networks with higher accuracy and fewer false positives than signature-based systems (AAE #3).
2.  **Automated IoT Device Vulnerability Scanning & Patching:** AI agent that regularly scans connected IoT devices for known vulnerabilities, assesses risks, and (with user permission) attempts automated patching or recommends mitigation steps (e.g., network segmentation).
3.  **Intelligent Firewall Rule Management:** AI analyzing traffic patterns and device roles to recommend or automatically generate appropriate firewall rules, simplifying configuration and reducing errors that could lead to exposure.
4.  **Adaptive Device/User Authentication:** Use AI analyzing behavioral patterns (e.g., typical connection times, data usage, accessed services) as part of a continuous authentication framework, flagging or challenging suspicious deviations even for known devices.
5.  **DNS Security Enhancement (AI-Based Filtering):** AI-powered DNS filtering that goes beyond blocklists, using machine learning to identify and block malicious or newly registered domains associated with phishing, malware, or C&C servers in real-time.
6.  **Enhanced Public Wi-Fi Security Analysis:** AI analyzing public Wi-Fi characteristics (encryption type, captive portal behavior, observed traffic patterns) to provide users with a more accurate security risk assessment before connecting (PE #4, AAE #7).
7.  **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Mitigation (AI-Assisted):** For managed networks or potentially advanced home routers, AI identifying DDoS patterns early and automatically applying mitigation techniques (rate limiting, traffic scrubbing).
8.  **Automated Security Log Analysis:** AI processing and correlating logs from routers, firewalls, and connected devices to identify complex attack patterns or indicators of compromise that might be missed by manual review (PE #9).
9.  **Privacy-Preserving Security Monitoring:** Implementing security monitoring techniques (especially those analyzing traffic content or user behavior) using privacy-preserving methods like federated learning (AOA #3), homomorphic encryption (where feasible), or on-device analysis to minimize exposure of sensitive user data (CISO #2).
