**Facilitator:** Welcome everyone. Today's goal is to refine concepts for AI tools specifically aimed at supporting neurodivergent experiences within software engineering, leveraging the insights from our prompt and the foundational work on general AI wellness. Crucially, all concepts must align with the ethical framework: user control, mandatory granular opt-in for data use, absolute privacy, transparency, and a strict non-diagnostic, non-therapeutic stance. Our pre-analysis revealed themes around direct support (Executive Function, Focus, Info Processing, Communication, Routine), Sensory Control, User Control/Personalization, Ethics, Technical Enablers, and Accessibility. Let's start by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the core support features, beginning with Executive Function aids like task decomposition and working memory support.

**PE:** Strength: Task decomposition prompts (PE #2) directly address initiation barriers. Weakness: The AI needs to be flexible; a rigid decomposition might not match the user's mental model. Working memory prompts (PE #8) are great for offloading, but could become a crutch if not designed carefully.

**SSE:** Working memory aids integrated into code navigation (SSE #3) would be fantastic for complex codebases, reducing the need to constantly re-scan or hold things in mind. Strength: Reduces cognitive load. Weakness: Needs to be performant (AOA #7) and visually unobtrusive.

**AAE:** We can build specialized agents (AAE #1, #3) for these. Strength: Dedicated logic. Weakness: Ensuring the agent's understanding of the task/context is accurate enough to provide useful decomposition or memory support. Transparency (AAE #8) is key – why did it break the task down *this* way?

**Psych:** These tools align well with supporting common executive function challenges (Psych #2). Strength: Potential to reduce daily friction. Weakness: We must avoid oversimplification that hinders skill development (Psych #7). It's support, not replacement. Language must remain neutral (Psych #8); it's "task breakdown assistance," not "executive dysfunction support" in the UI.

**Thrp:** Reinforces agency if the user controls *how* tasks are decomposed or what's remembered (Thrp #1). Weakness: Risk of user frustration if the AI consistently gets it wrong or the support feels intrusive.

**Facilitator:** Good points. How about Attention/Focus Management – interruption filtering, re-engagement prompts?

**AI UX:** High customizability is key here (AI UX #1, #5). Users need granular control over *what* constitutes an interruption and *how* focus modes behave (AOA #6). Strength: Potentially huge impact on maintaining flow state. Weakness: Designing an interface for this level of control without it becoming overwhelming itself (Couns #6).

**SSE:** Hyperfocus support (SSE #8) is interesting. Maybe subtle visual cues instead of pop-ups during detected deep work? Weakness: Reliably detecting hyperfocus vs. just being busy is hard. Needs user input/confirmation.

**AAE:** The Adaptive Focus Agent (AAE #2) aims at this, learning patterns. Strength: Personalization. Weakness: Requires opt-in pattern analysis, raising privacy flags (SecEng #2, CISO #5). Needs robust privacy measures and transparency.

**Couns:** Normalizing focus support as a productivity tool for everyone can reduce potential stigma (Ther #6). Strength: Supports diverse needs. Weakness: Ensuring it doesn't inadvertently penalize users whose work patterns deviate significantly.

**Facilitator:** Let's discuss Information Processing – adaptive clarity, visual summaries, ambiguity reduction.

**PE:** Adaptive clarity (PE #1) and reducing ambiguity (PE #4) are core prompt engineering goals here. Strength: Makes AI interaction more accessible. Weakness: Determining the 'right' level of clarity adaptively is challenging. Might need explicit user feedback loops (AI UX #8).

**SSE:** Structured/visual summaries (SSE #5, #6) cater to different thinking styles. Strength: Improves comprehension of complex systems. Weakness: Generating accurate diagrams automatically is complex.

**PO:** Flexible visualization for planning (PO #1) is also crucial. Showing the same plan as a list, board, or timeline helps different people grasp it. Strength: Inclusive communication. Weakness: Requires robust backend data structure.

**Psych:** These directly support diverse information processing styles (Psych #4). Strength: Lowers cognitive barriers. Weakness: Ensure visual summaries don't lose critical nuance. Transparency of summarization logic is good (Psych #9).

**Facilitator:** Moving to Communication Styles – preference settings, translation aids.

**AI UX:** The configuration UI (AI UX #2) must be clear. Users select *their* preferred style and how the AI should respond. Strength: Respects user preferences. Weakness: Defining styles clearly and avoiding stereotypes.

**AAE:** The Translation Agent (AAE #4) is powerful but risky. Strength: Could bridge communication gaps. Weakness: High potential for misinterpretation, ethical concerns about altering communication without explicit consent of *all* parties in a conversation? (Ther #7). Needs very careful scoping. Maybe only for AI interactions initially?

**Couns:** Focus on the self-advocacy aspect (Couns #1) – using the tool to help the user *articulate* their needs is less risky than automated translation between users.

**SecEng:** Secure handling of style preferences is vital (SecEng #1). Translation needs secure implementation (SecEng #8) to prevent data leakage or manipulation.

**Facilitator:** And Routine/Structure support?

**PE:** Routine-building prompts (PE #9) and templates provide scaffolding (Counselor #2). Strength: Reduces cognitive load of task initiation/sequencing. Weakness: Must be easily customizable by the user.

**AAE:** Routine Automation Agent (AAE #6) takes this further. Strength: Handles recurring multi-step tasks. Weakness: Requires robust definition and reliable execution.

**Facilitator:** Now, let's talk challenges and solutions. A key one is balancing support with maintaining user skills and agency.

**Psych:** The solution involves transparency (Psych #9, AAE #8), user control (AI UX #1), and framing features as *tools* not *crutches*. Offer levels of support – e.g., hint vs. full answer. Avoid black boxes.

**Thrp:** Emphasize user agency in all interactions (Thrp #1). The user should always feel in command of the tool, not managed by it. Feedback mechanisms (AI UX #8) are crucial for tuning the support level.

**Couns:** Focus on indirect skill building (Couns #5). If the AI explains *how* it decomposed a task, the user might learn that strategy.

**Facilitator:** Another challenge: ensuring privacy and ethical use, especially with adaptive features.

**CISO:** Non-negotiables: Explicit Ethical Framework (CISO #1), mandatory granular opt-in (CISO #5), strict data governance classifying preferences as sensitive (CISO #2), no predictive profiling (CISO #6), regular audits involving neurodivergent users (CISO #8). Privacy-preserving techniques are essential (SecEng #2).

**SecEng:** Prioritize on-device processing where possible (AOA #4). Minimize data collection (SecEng #5). Ensure robust security for preference stores and APIs (SecEng #1, #4). Audit trails are key (SecEng #9).

**AOA:** Architect for modularity (AOA #1) so users only enable what they need. Design for data flow transparency (AOA #8). Have fail-safe defaults (AOA #9).

**Facilitator:** How about avoiding stigma?

**Thrp:** Frame features as advanced customization or productivity enhancements available to everyone (Ther #6). Focus marketing and UI language on benefits like 'reduced cognitive load' or 'enhanced focus', not on deficits.

**AI UX:** Allow personalization without forcing disclosure (AI UX #6). Offer powerful customization options universally.

**Facilitator:** Okay, great discussion. Let's move towards selecting our top 15 concepts, focusing on impact, feasibility, user control, and ethical soundness.
