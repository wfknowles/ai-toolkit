# Psychiatrist - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts (Cognitive/Clinical Perspective - Non-Implementer)

Focusing on cognitive functions, potential impacts, and strict non-diagnostic boundaries:

1.  **Explicit Non-Diagnostic Stance:** System design and communication must rigorously avoid any semblance of diagnosing neurodevelopmental conditions. This is a support tool, not a clinical instrument (Therapist #9).
2.  **Executive Function Support:** Acknowledge that features targeting task initiation, planning, organization (PE #2), working memory (SSE #3, AAE #3), and flexible thinking (e.g., suggesting alternative approaches - Wellness #5) align with common areas of executive function challenge.
3.  **Attention Regulation Aids:** Focus management tools (PE #3, AAE #2), noise reduction (SSE #1), and context switching support (SSE #2) could potentially aid users with attention regulation difficulties, but effectiveness will vary widely.
4.  **Information Processing Support:** Features like summarization (SSE #5, AAE #5), code visualization (SSE #6), and adaptive prompt clarity (PE #1) cater to diverse information processing styles.
5.  **Cognitive Load Management:** Many concepts aim to reduce extraneous cognitive load (e.g., automation - SSE #9, context gathering - Wellness #4). This is generally beneficial but monitor for potential over-simplification that hinders learning.
6.  **Variability of Neurodivergence:** Emphasize that neurodivergence is highly variable. Tools must be customizable (AI UX #1) as a strategy helpful for one person may be unhelpful or annoying for another.
7.  **Potential Impact on Cognitive Skills:** Consider whether long-term use of cognitive offloading tools (e.g., working memory aids) could impact the user's own skill maintenance in that area. Balance support with opportunities for engagement.
8.  **Language and Framing:** Use precise, objective language. Avoid jargon or terms that pathologize (Therapist #2). Focus on supporting *tasks* or managing *work patterns*, not 'treating symptoms'.
9.  **Transparency of AI Reasoning:** For features like code explanation or task breakdown, ensure the AI's reasoning process is transparent where possible. This aids user understanding and learning, rather than just providing a black-box answer (Counselor #5).
