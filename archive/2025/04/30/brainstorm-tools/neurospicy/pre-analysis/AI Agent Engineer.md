# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Developing agent capabilities specialized for neurodivergent support needs:

1.  **Executive Function Support Agents:** Design specialized agents for tasks like breaking down complex goals (PE #2), planning steps, maintaining focus (PE #3), and reminding users of context or pending items (PE #8).
2.  **Adaptive Focus Management Agent:** An agent that can learn (based on opt-in data and user feedback) the user's focus patterns and intelligently manage notifications or interruptions, potentially coordinating with calendar focus blocks (SSE #8, AOA #6).
3.  **Working Memory Augmentation Agent:** An agent specifically designed to act as an external working memory, holding context, summarizing information dynamically, and providing quick access to relevant details during complex tasks (SSE #3, PE #8).
4.  **Communication Style Translation Agent:** An agent that can (optionally, with user configuration) help translate between different communication styles in written interactions, e.g., making text more direct or adding elaborative examples (AI UX #2, Therapist #7).
5.  **Predictive Task Initiation Agent:** An agent that anticipates upcoming tasks (based on calendar, task lists) and proactively gathers resources or suggests initial steps to help overcome initiation hurdles (related to Wellness AAE #2, SSE #9).
6.  **Routine Automation Agent:** Agents capable of learning and automating personalized multi-step routines or workflows defined by the user, reducing the cognitive load of managing recurring tasks (PE #9, Counselor #2).
7.  **Sensory Input Filtering Agent:** An agent that can filter or reformat information streams (like logs, notifications, or even cluttered UIs) based on user-defined rules to reduce sensory overload (SSE #1).
8.  **Transparent Agent Reasoning:** Ensure agents can explain *why* they are making a suggestion or taking an action, especially for adaptive features, fostering trust and understanding (Psychiatrist #9, AOA #8).
9.  **Robust Agent Failure/Fallback:** Design agents with clear fallback mechanisms and error reporting. Failure should be non-disruptive and provide guidance, avoiding increased user frustration (related to Wellness AAE #9).
