# Therapist - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts (Psychosocial/Ethical Perspective - Non-Implementer)

Focusing on psychosocial impact, ethics, and maintaining professional boundaries:

1.  **Reinforce User Agency:** All tools must empower the user, enhancing their sense of control and self-efficacy, not creating dependency (Wellness #1, AI UX #1).
2.  **Avoid Pathologizing Language:** Ensure all UI text, prompts, and feedback avoid diagnostic labels or language that frames neurodivergent traits negatively (Psychiatrist #8).
3.  **Support Self-Understanding (Carefully):** Opt-in pattern reflection (Wellness #2) *could* support self-understanding if presented neutrally and factually, focusing on work patterns, not traits. Must avoid interpretation or advice (Counselor #8).
4.  **Manage Expectations:** Clearly communicate that AI tools are for workflow support and productivity enhancement, *not* mental health treatment or a substitute for therapy/coaching.
5.  **Potential for Misinterpretation:** Users might misinterpret neutral feedback or pattern data negatively. Provide clear explanations and context; consider allowing users to add their own annotations to reflected data.
6.  **Stigma Considerations:** Be mindful of potential stigma. Ensure features are presented as productivity tools available to everyone, with enhanced customization options for those who choose them. Avoid creating features that overtly single out neurodivergent users unless explicitly configured by them.
7.  **Impact on Social Interaction:** Consider how AI tools might impact team communication. Tools translating communication styles (AI UX #2) need careful design to avoid misrepresentation or oversimplification.
8.  **Burnout Prevention Focus:** Frame wellness nudges and workload management tools (PO #1, PM #1) explicitly around sustainable work practices and burnout prevention for *all* users, leveraging customization for specific needs.
9.  **Strict Boundary Adherence:** The AI must never engage in therapeutic conversation, offer emotional support beyond simple positive task reinforcement (Wellness #1, PE #4), or analyze/interpret subjective user feelings (Psychiatrist #1).
