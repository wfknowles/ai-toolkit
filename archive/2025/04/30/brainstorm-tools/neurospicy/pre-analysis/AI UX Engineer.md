# AI UX Engineer - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Designing interfaces and interactions for clarity, control, and cognitive accessibility:

1.  **Highly Customizable UI:** Design interfaces allowing deep customization of layout, density, color schemes, font sizes, and element visibility to cater to individual sensory needs and preferences (AOA #1, Psychiatrist #6).
2.  **Communication Style Configuration:** Design the UI for users to easily select and preview how the AI communicates (directness, detail level, use of examples, tone) and potentially how their own input is interpreted or relayed (PE #5, Counselor #1).
3.  **Adaptive Interface Elements:** Design UI components that can dynamically adjust complexity or information density based on user preference, task context, or interaction patterns (e.g., showing simplified controls by default, revealing advanced options on demand) (AOA #3).
4.  **Clear State and Mode Indication:** Ensure the UI always clearly indicates the current state, active modes (e.g., focus mode), or AI assistance being provided, reducing ambiguity and potential confusion.
5.  **Sensory-Considerate Notifications:** Design notification systems with options for different modalities (visual, subtle sound, haptic), adjustable intensity, and grouping/batching capabilities to minimize disruption and sensory overload (AOA #6).
6.  **Personalized Onboarding Experience:** Design an onboarding flow that introduces features gradually, allows users to self-identify areas where they might want support (optional), and customizes initial settings based on their choices (Counselor #6).
7.  **Visual Task Structuring Tools:** Design UI elements that help visualize task breakdowns, dependencies, or progress in multiple formats (checklists, progress bars, simple flowcharts) (PO #1, SSE #9).
8.  **Integrated Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide intuitive, low-effort ways for users to give feedback specifically on the helpfulness, clarity, or disruptiveness of AI suggestions and UI elements (related to Wellness AI UX #8).
9.  **Accessibility First Design:** Ensure all UI elements and interactions rigorously adhere to WCAG standards and beyond, considering cognitive accessibility aspects like clear language, predictable navigation, and sufficient time for interaction.
