# Prompt Engineer - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Adapting prompt design principles for neurodivergent user needs:

1.  **Adaptive Clarity Prompts:** Design prompts that can automatically adjust their level of detail or structure based on user preference or detected interaction patterns (e.g., if a user consistently asks for clarification, offer more structured prompts).
2.  **Explicit Task Decomposition Prompts:** Prompts specifically designed to help users break down large or ambiguous tasks into smaller, concrete steps, supporting executive function (Psychiatrist #2).
3.  **Focus & Re-Engagement Prompts:** Building on Wellness #5, craft prompts to help regain focus after interruptions, perhaps offering tiered summaries (headline, key points, full context) based on user choice.
4.  **Reduced Ambiguity Prompting:** Systematically review and refine common system prompts to minimize ambiguity, jargon, or implied meanings that could be challenging for literal thinkers or those with certain processing styles.
5.  **Preference-Driven Communication Style Prompts:** Prompts allowing users to define *their* preferred communication style (e.g., direct, detailed, with examples) and instruct the AI assistant to respond accordingly (AI UX #2, Counselor #1).
6.  **Visual Structure in Prompts:** Incorporate formatting options within prompts (like markdown, bullet points, checklists) that the AI can use in its responses to provide more visual structure, aiding information processing.
7.  **Error Message Rewriting Prompts:** Prompts designed to take standard, often cryptic, system error messages and rewrite them into clearer, step-by-step explanations with actionable suggestions (related to Wellness #5, AAE #7).
8.  **Working Memory Support Prompts:** Prompts that explicitly help externalize information, like summarizing key decisions made during a session, listing completed sub-tasks, or holding 'reminders' provided by the user.
9.  **Routine Building Prompts:** Designing prompt sequences or templates that help users establish and follow personalized work routines (e.g., startup checklists, end-of-day wrap-ups, specific task workflows) (Counselor #2).
