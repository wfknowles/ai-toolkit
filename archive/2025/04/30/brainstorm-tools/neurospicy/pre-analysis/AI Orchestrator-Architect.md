# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Architecting systems for flexible, personalized, and privacy-preserving neuro-support:

1.  **Modular Support Feature Architecture:** Design the system as a set of independent, toggleable support modules (e.g., focus assist, task decomposition, communication helper) rather than a monolithic system, allowing users to pick and choose (AI UX #1).
2.  **Centralized User Preference Store:** Architect a secure, robust store for granular user preferences related to neuro-support features (e.g., clarity levels, communication styles, preferred visual layouts, sensory sensitivities for notifications) (related to Wellness #8, AI UX #6).
3.  **Context Aggregation for Adaptive Interfaces:** Orchestrate the secure aggregation of relevant context (IDE state, calendar, task focus, user preferences) to enable adaptive UI/prompt adjustments (PE #1, AI UX #3).
4.  **Privacy-Preserving Interaction Analysis:** If interaction patterns are used for adaptation (PE #1), design the analysis architecture to be privacy-preserving, potentially using on-device processing or secure aggregation, strictly opt-in (Wellness #2, CISO #2).
5.  **Interoperability Layer for Assistive Tech:** Consider designing an API or interoperability layer that could potentially allow integration with existing third-party assistive technologies users might already employ (requires careful security/privacy review - CISO #3).
6.  **Flexible Notification System:** Enhance the Wellness #7 concept to allow fine-grained user control over notification modality (sound, visual pop-up, subtle UI change), frequency, and timing, catering to sensory sensitivities.
7.  **Resource Management for Cognitive Aids:** Ensure the architecture efficiently manages resources for potentially computationally intensive support features (e.g., real-time code analysis/explanation) to avoid system sluggishness, which can be a source of frustration.
8.  **Data Flow Transparency Architecture:** Design data flows with transparency in mind, allowing the system (and potentially the user, via UI) to trace *why* a particular adaptation or suggestion was made (Psychiatrist #9).
9.  **Fail-Safe Defaults:** Ensure that if any adaptive or personalized neuro-support feature fails or is disabled, the system gracefully degrades to a standard, functional baseline experience without causing disruption.
