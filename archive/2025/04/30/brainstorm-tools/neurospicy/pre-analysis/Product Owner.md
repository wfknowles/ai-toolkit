# Product Owner - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Supporting planning, communication, and value delivery with neurodiversity in mind:

1.  **Flexible Work Visualization Tools:** AI assisting in visualizing backlogs, roadmaps, and progress using different formats (lists, Kanban, timelines, mind maps) catering to diverse visual processing preferences.
2.  **Communication Style Assistance:** AI helping draft communications (user stories, updates, requirements) that are clear, concise, and minimize ambiguity, potentially offering style suggestions based on audience profiles (if available and appropriate).
3.  **Predictable Sprint Planning Aids:** AI providing data-driven insights on historical task completion times (considering complexity/type) to aid in more predictable sprint loading, reducing pressure from overcommitment (related to Wellness PO #2).
4.  **Requirement Clarification Assistant:** AI analyzing user stories or requirements for potential ambiguities or missing information, prompting the PO for clarification before development begins.
5.  **Change Impact Analysis:** AI helping to quickly assess the potential impact of scope changes or new requests on existing plans and dependencies, aiding rapid, informed decision-making.
6.  **Structured Feedback Summarization:** AI summarizing user feedback or stakeholder input into structured formats (themes, key quotes, action items), reducing the cognitive load of processing large amounts of unstructured text (related to Wellness PO #6).
7.  **Meeting Support - Action Item Focus:** AI assisting during meetings (with participant consent) by identifying potential action items or decisions in real-time, helping ensure clarity and follow-through.
8.  **Cross-Functional Dependency Mapping:** AI tools that help visualize and communicate dependencies between different features or teams in a clear, graphical way, improving shared understanding.
9.  **Value Proposition Articulation Aid:** AI assisting the PO in articulating the value proposition of features using different frameworks or language styles, ensuring clear communication to diverse stakeholders.
