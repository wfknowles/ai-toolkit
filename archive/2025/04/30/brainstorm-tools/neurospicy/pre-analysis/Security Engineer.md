# Security Engineer - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Ensuring the security and privacy of personalized support features:

1.  **Secure Storage of Sensitivity Preferences:** User preferences related to sensory sensitivities, communication styles, or focus needs (AOA #2) must be treated as sensitive data and stored with strong encryption and access controls.
2.  **Privacy-Preserving Pattern Analysis:** Any analysis of user interaction patterns for adaptive features (AOA #4) must adhere to strict privacy protocols (e.g., on-device processing, differential privacy, secure aggregation) and require explicit, granular user opt-in (CISO #6).
3.  **Input Validation for Customization:** Robust input validation is needed for all customization fields (UI themes, notification rules, etc.) to prevent injection attacks or unintended system behavior.
4.  **Secure API for Preferences:** The API managing user preferences (related to Wellness SecEng #5) must be strongly authenticated and authorized to prevent unauthorized access or modification of potentially sensitive settings.
5.  **Data Minimization:** Collect only the minimum data necessary for each specific neuro-support feature to function. Avoid collecting broad behavioral data unless explicitly opted-in for a specific purpose (e.g., adaptive focus agent - AAE #2).
6.  **Vetting Third-Party Integrations:** Thoroughly vet any potential integrations with third-party assistive technologies (AOA #5) for security vulnerabilities and data privacy practices (CISO #3).
7.  **Preventing Profile Inference:** Design systems to prevent unintended inference or correlation of different user preference data points that could lead to sensitive profiling beyond the user's explicit consent.
8.  **Secure Communication Translation:** If implementing communication style translation (AAE #4), ensure the process is secure and does not leak sensitive information or allow manipulation of communication content in transit.
9.  **Audit Trails for Sensitive Settings:** Implement detailed audit logs for any changes made to sensitive user preference settings (e.g., communication styles, opt-in status for pattern analysis), accessible to the user.
