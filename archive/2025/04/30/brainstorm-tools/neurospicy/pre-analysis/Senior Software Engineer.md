# Senior Software Engineer - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Leveraging AI to address specific software engineering challenges from a neurodivergent perspective:

1.  **Sensory-Friendly Debugging Tools:** AI tools that filter or highlight logs/stack traces based on user-defined patterns, reducing visual clutter and sensory overload during debugging.
2.  **Predictable Environment Management:** AI agents that ensure development/testing environments are set up consistently and predictably every time, reducing unexpected issues that can disrupt flow (related to Wellness SSE #8).
3.  **Working Memory Aids for Code Navigation:** AI providing persistent, easily accessible summaries of relevant code context (variable definitions, function signatures, call stacks) while navigating large codebases (related to Wellness SSE #3, PE #8).
4.  **Code Consistency Enforcement Agent:** An AI agent that proactively identifies and suggests fixes for stylistic inconsistencies or deviations from team standards, reducing the cognitive load of tracking these details manually.
5.  **Structured Code Summarization:** AI generating code summaries not just as prose, but potentially as structured diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams) or bullet points, catering to different processing styles (Psychiatrist #4).
6.  **Visualizing Code Complexity:** AI tools that analyze and visualize code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, coupling) can help identify potentially overwhelming sections of code before diving in.
7.  **Intent-Based Code Generation:** AI assisting not just with boilerplate, but generating code based on clearer, structured descriptions of intent, potentially reducing the translation effort from thought to code.
8.  **Hyperfocus Support Tools:** AI features that help *maintain* focus during hyperfocus states, e.g., by batching non-critical notifications or providing very subtle cues for essential breaks, configurable by the user (related to AAE #2).
9.  **Automated Task Scaffolding:** For common maintenance tasks, AI generating a skeletal structure or checklist of steps within the IDE, providing a starting point and reducing initiation barriers (related to PE #2).
