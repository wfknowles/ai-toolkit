# CISO - Initial Neuro-Supportive AI Concepts

Establishing governance, risk management, and ethical oversight for neuro-supportive AI:

1.  **Explicit Ethical Framework:** Define and enforce a clear ethical framework specifically addressing AI support for neurodivergent users, incorporating principles from prerequisites (Wellness #14) and adding focus on non-discrimination, equity, and avoiding digital divides.
2.  **Data Governance for Neuro-Preferences:** Classify user-configured neuro-support preferences (communication styles, sensory settings, etc.) as sensitive data, defining strict access controls, retention policies, and secure disposal procedures compliant with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) (related to Wellness CISO #2).
3.  **Third-Party Risk Management for Assistive Tech:** Establish rigorous security and privacy assessment processes for any considered integrations with third-party assistive technologies or specialized AI models (SecEng #6).
4.  **Compliance with Accessibility & Labor Laws:** Ensure all features and underlying systems comply not only with WCAG but also relevant disability discrimination laws and labor regulations concerning workplace accommodations.
5.  **Mandatory, Granular Opt-In & Consent:** Reiterate and enforce mandatory, granular opt-in for *any* data collection or analysis beyond basic functionality. Consent language must be exceptionally clear, accessible, and easy to revoke (related to Wellness CISO #6, SecEng #2).
6.  **Prohibition of Predictive Profiling:** Explicitly prohibit the use of collected data or interaction patterns for predictive profiling related to neurodevelopmental conditions, performance evaluation, or any purpose beyond the user-consented immediate feature functionality (SecEng #7).
7.  **Incident Response for Preference Data:** Ensure Incident Response Plans specifically cover potential breaches or misuse of sensitive user preference data related to neuro-support features.
8.  **Regular Audits & Ethical Reviews:** Mandate periodic independent audits of security controls, privacy practices, and ethical alignment for these features, involving diverse stakeholders including neurodivergent individuals (related to Wellness CISO #8).
9.  **Clear Policy on Data Access:** Reinforce absolute prohibition of manager, HR, or unauthorized access to individual user configuration data or interaction patterns related to neuro-support features. Define clear policies for any *anonymized, aggregated* reporting if ever deemed necessary and ethical (requires extreme caution and user consent).
