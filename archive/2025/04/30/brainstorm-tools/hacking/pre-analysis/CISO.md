# CISO - Initial Concepts on "Unhackability"

Focusing on governance, risk management, compliance, and strategic security posture:

1.  **Risk Acceptance Threshold for "Unhackability":** Define the organizational risk tolerance. Since true "unhackability" is theoretical (Ther #9), define acceptable levels of residual risk and the required investment in resilience measures (defense-in-depth, rapid recovery).
2.  **Governance Framework for Autonomous Defense:** Establish a strict governance framework, including rules of engagement, human oversight requirements, and auditing for any AI agents capable of autonomous defensive actions (AOA #7, AAE #6, Ther #7).
3.  **Supply Chain Risk Management (AI/ML Specific):** Implement rigorous vetting processes for third-party AI models, libraries, and data sources, assessing their security posture, training data provenance, and potential vulnerabilities (SSE #5).
4.  **Compliance with AI Regulations & Standards:** Ensure all AI security measures and systems comply with emerging AI regulations, data privacy laws (GDPR, etc.), and relevant security standards (NIST AI RMF, ISO 27001).
5.  **Board-Level Communication of AI Security Posture:** Develop clear metrics and reporting mechanisms to communicate the security posture of AI systems, associated risks, and the effectiveness of "unhackability" initiatives to executive leadership and the board.
6.  **Incident Response Planning for AI Compromise:** Develop and regularly test incident response plans specifically addressing scenarios involving compromised AI models, data poisoning, agent manipulation, or large-scale adversarial attacks.
7.  **Investment in Proactive Security Research:** Allocate resources for ongoing research into AI security threats, adversarial ML techniques, and cutting-edge defensive technologies (e.g., formal methods, PQC - SecEng #5, #9) to stay ahead of attackers.
8.  **Ethical Review of Extreme Security Measures:** Establish an ethics review process for evaluating potentially controversial security measures like AI-driven deception, autonomous response, or behavioral monitoring, ensuring alignment with organizational values (Ther #7).
9.  **Zero Trust Mandate & Enforcement:** Champion and enforce a strict Zero Trust Architecture (AOA #1) across the organization, particularly for systems incorporating AI, ensuring continuous verification and least privilege access.
