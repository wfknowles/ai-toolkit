# Product Owner - Initial Concepts on "Unhackability"

Focusing on balancing security requirements with product value and user experience:

1.  **AI-Assisted Security Requirements Definition:** AI analyzing product features and suggesting relevant security requirements, threat models, or abuse cases to consider during planning (e.g., "Feature X handles PII, consider encryption, access control, audit logging requirements").
2.  **Security vs. Feature Velocity Tradeoff Analysis:** AI modeling the potential impact of different security controls or architectures on development time, cost, and user experience, helping POs make informed tradeoff decisions (Counselor #6).
3.  **Prioritization of Security Work (Risk-Based):** AI assisting in prioritizing security backlog items (vulnerabilities, tech debt) based on quantifiable risk factors (e.g., CVSS, exploitability, potential business impact, regulatory fines) rather than just severity.
4.  **Communicating Security Value to Stakeholders:** AI helping translate technical security measures and risks into clear business terms and value propositions for non-technical stakeholders.
5.  **User Experience Impact of Security Features:** Using AI to analyze user feedback or simulate user journeys to identify potential friction points caused by security measures, informing UX improvements (AI UX #3, Ther #4).
6.  **Compliance Requirement Mapping:** AI automatically mapping product features and data handling processes to relevant compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), identifying potential gaps early.
7.  **Security Incident Impact Estimation (Product Lens):** During an incident, AI helping to estimate the potential impact on users, product reputation, and business metrics to inform response prioritization and communication.
8.  **Security Acceptance Criteria Generation:** AI assisting in drafting clear, measurable security-related acceptance criteria for user stories.
9.  **"Security by Design" Feature Planning:** AI prompts or checklists integrated into the feature planning process to ensure security considerations are addressed proactively from the outset, not bolted on later.
