# Security Engineer - Initial Concepts on "Unhackability"

Focusing on core security principles, threat detection, and response in AI-infused systems:

1.  **AI-Enhanced Threat Intelligence Correlation:** Use AI to automatically ingest, correlate, and prioritize threat intelligence feeds, identifying relevant indicators of compromise (IoCs) or attacker TTPs applicable to the specific environment.
2.  **Advanced Anomaly Detection:** Implement AI-driven anomaly detection across multiple layers (network, endpoint, application, user behavior, AI model behavior) to identify deviations indicative of novel or sophisticated attacks (Psych #7, AOA #7).
3.  **Automated Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing:** Utilize AI to automate aspects of vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, including simulating known attack patterns and exploring potential zero-day exploit paths (PE #4).
4.  **Cryptographically Enforced Immutability:** Explore use of cryptographic techniques (e.g., hash chaining, digital signatures on code/data/models) to enforce and verify the immutability of critical system components (AOA #2, AOA #9).
5.  **Formal Verification of Security Properties:** Leverage AI-assisted formal methods tools to mathematically prove specific security properties (e.g., absence of certain vulnerability classes, correct implementation of access control logic) in critical code segments (SSE #6).
6.  **AI-Driven Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):** Enhance SOAR platforms with AI to improve alert triage, automate enrichment tasks, suggest response actions, and orchestrate complex response workflows (AAE #6).
7.  **Secure AI Model Management:** Implement robust security controls around AI model storage, versioning, access control, and deployment, protecting against model theft, tampering, or unauthorized use.
8.  **Moving Target Defense (MTD) Strategies:** Explore AI-driven MTD techniques, dynamically changing system configurations (e.g., IP addresses, memory layouts, API endpoints) to increase attacker difficulty and reduce the window for exploitation.
9.  **Post-Quantum Cryptography Preparedness:** Begin research and planning for transitioning critical cryptographic functions to post-quantum algorithms to ensure long-term resilience against future threats.
