# Prompt Engineer - Initial Concepts on "Unhackability"

Focusing on securing AI/LLM interactions and leveraging prompts for defense:

1.  **Robust Prompt Injection Defense:** Design multi-layered defenses against prompt injection, including input sanitization, output parsing, instructional prompts defining strict boundaries, using separate privileged/unprivileged LLM calls, and potentially AI models trained specifically to detect injection attempts.
2.  **Output Content Filtering & Validation:** Implement strict filtering and validation on LLM outputs to prevent leaking sensitive information, generating malicious code/commands, or enabling downstream exploits. Validate that output conforms to expected formats/schemas.
3.  **Contextual Boundary Enforcement Prompts:** Craft meta-prompts or system instructions that dynamically reinforce context boundaries based on the task, preventing the LLM from accessing or revealing information outside its authorized scope for a given interaction.
4.  **Adversarial Prompt Simulation:** Use AI (potentially another LLM) to generate adversarial prompts targeting the system's defenses, allowing for automated red-teaming and identification of prompt injection vulnerabilities before deployment.
5.  **Few-Shot Prompting for Secure Behavior:** Utilize few-shot prompting techniques to explicitly demonstrate secure behaviors and desired response patterns to the LLM, reinforcing security guidelines.
6.  **Prompt Obfuscation/Abstraction Layers:** Explore techniques to abstract or obfuscate user prompts before they reach the core LLM, potentially mitigating certain injection vectors by transforming the input.
7.  **LLM Response Monitoring for Anomalies:** Use secondary AI models or rule-based systems to monitor LLM responses for anomalies, unexpected shifts in behavior, or indicators of potential compromise or manipulation (e.g., sudden verbosity changes, attempts to bypass filters).
8.  **Least Privilege Prompting:** Ensure prompts only provide the LLM with the minimum necessary information and context required to perform the requested task, minimizing the potential attack surface if the prompt context is leaked or misused.
9.  **Secure Prompt Templating & Management:** Implement secure practices for storing, managing, and versioning prompts, preventing unauthorized modifications that could introduce vulnerabilities.
