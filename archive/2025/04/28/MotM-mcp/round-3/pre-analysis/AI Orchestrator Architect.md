# AI Orchestrator/Architect Pre-Analysis (Round 3)

**Review of Prerequisites:**
- Reviewed round 2 group interview, analysis, and requirements.
- Focused on orchestrator extensibility, error handling, and state management.

**Initial Concept Analysis:**
- The orchestrator must support phased rollout and modular upgrades.
- Each phase should have clear state transition and error recovery plans.

**Milestones, Phases, Steps:**
- Phase 1: Define orchestrator upgrade path and versioning
- Phase 2: Implement modular workflow step registration
- Phase 3: Integrate error propagation and recovery modules
- Phase 4: Validate state handoff and rollback mechanisms
- Phase 5: Document API contracts and onboarding guides

**Potential Blindspots:**
- Overlooking backward compatibility in orchestrator upgrades
- Insufficient error logging for root cause analysis

**Recommendations:**
- Establish versioning policy for orchestrator modules
- Require rollback plans for all workflow changes
