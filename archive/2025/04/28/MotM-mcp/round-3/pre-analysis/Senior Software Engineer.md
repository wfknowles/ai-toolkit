# Senior Software Engineer Pre-Analysis (Round 3)

**Review of Prerequisites:**
- Reviewed round 2 group interview, analysis, and requirements.
- Focused on maintainability, testability, and integration of LLM-driven logic.

**Initial Concept Analysis:**
- The codebase must remain modular and testable as new features are added.
- Interfaces between orchestrator, agent, and tool adapters must be finalized early.

**Milestones, Phases, Steps:**
- Phase 1: Refine and document core interfaces
- Phase 2: Implement static analysis and code linting in CI
- Phase 3: Develop core modules with unit and integration tests
- Phase 4: Integrate new tools and agent behaviors
- Phase 5: Conduct code reviews and technical debt assessments

**Potential Blindspots:**
- Technical debt accumulation during rapid prototyping
- Insufficient test coverage for dynamic agent behaviors

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce test coverage thresholds in CI
- Schedule regular technical debt reviews
