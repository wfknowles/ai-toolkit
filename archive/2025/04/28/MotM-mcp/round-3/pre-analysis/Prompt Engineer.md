# Prompt Engineer Pre-Analysis (Round 3)

**Review of Prerequisites:**
- Carefully reviewed the round 2 group interview, analysis, and requirements documentation.
- Noted the established modular, service-oriented architecture, standardized interfaces, and robust compliance/security requirements.

**Initial Concept Analysis:**
- The project is at a stage where clear milestones and phases are needed to move from requirements to actionable implementation.
- The requirements are comprehensive, but the transition to user stories and tasks needs to be tightly managed to avoid scope creep and ensure traceability.

**Milestones, Phases, Steps:**
- Phase 1: Project Planning & Onboarding
  - Review requirements, define project charter, onboard team
- Phase 2: Architecture & Design
  - Finalize architecture, define interfaces, create design documentation
- Phase 3: Implementation
  - Develop orchestrator, agent framework, tool adapters, CI/CD, security modules
- Phase 4: Testing & Validation
  - Unit, integration, end-to-end, and compliance testing
- Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
  - Deploy MVP, set up monitoring, incident response, and feedback loops
- Phase 6: Iteration & Improvement
  - Incorporate user feedback, address technical debt, refine features

**Potential Blindspots:**
- Risk of requirements drift during translation to user stories
- Need for clear acceptance criteria for each milestone
- Ensuring all compliance/privacy/legal requirements are mapped to actionable tasks

**Recommendations:**
- Use traceability matrices to map requirements to user stories and tasks
- Schedule regular milestone reviews
- Involve compliance and security SMEs in all planning phases
