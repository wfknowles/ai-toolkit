# AI Agent Engineer Pre-Analysis (Round 3)

**Review of Prerequisites:**
- Reviewed round 2 group interview, analysis, and requirements.
- Focused on agent modularity, explainability, and tool integration.

**Initial Concept Analysis:**
- Agent behaviors must be testable and explainable at each phase.
- Tool adapter integration should be planned for incremental rollout.

**Milestones, Phases, Steps:**
- Phase 1: Define agent behavior protocols and explainability standards
- Phase 2: Develop modular agent framework and test harnesses
- Phase 3: Integrate tool adapters incrementally
- Phase 4: Monitor and log agent actions for traceability
- Phase 5: Review and refine agent autonomy boundaries

**Potential Blindspots:**
- Insufficient explainability for complex agent decisions
- Tool integration complexity as the system scales

**Recommendations:**
- Prioritize explainability in agent design
- Schedule regular reviews of agent-tool interactions
