# MotM-mcp Round 3 SME Group Interview

## Phase 1: Group Analysis of Insights

**Facilitator:** Welcome, everyone. Let's begin by sharing our perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of the insights from your individual interviews.

**Prompt Engineer:** The emphasis on traceability and actionable milestones is strong, but there is a risk of requirements drift and insufficient granularity in milestone definitions.

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** Backward compatibility and robust error recovery are critical, but can be complex to implement. Skipping rollback planning is a major risk.

**Senior Software Engineer:** Maintaining code quality and test coverage is essential, but technical debt can accumulate quickly if documentation and testing are skipped.

**Principal Architect:** Architectural consistency and onboarding are key, but living documentation is hard to maintain as teams scale.

**Product Owner:** User value and feedback integration are vital, but there is a risk of misalignment between technical deliverables and user needs.

**Project Manager:** Clear milestones and risk management are strengths, but resource allocation and risk reviews are often underestimated.

**AI UX Engineer:** Embedding accessibility and user feedback in every phase is important, but edge cases and diverse needs can be overlooked.

**AI Agent Engineer:** Explainability and traceability of agent behaviors are crucial, but tool integration complexity and logging can be challenging as the system scales.

## Phase 2: Discussion of Challenges and Unknowns

**Facilitator:** Let's discuss the specific challenges and unknowns. Where do you see the biggest risks or gaps?

**Prompt Engineer:** How do we ensure traceability from requirements to implementation as the project evolves?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** How do we validate error recovery and ensure seamless upgrades?

**Senior Software Engineer:** How do we coordinate interface changes and maintain test coverage as requirements change?

**Principal Architect:** How do we keep documentation current and onboard new contributors effectively?

**Product Owner:** How do we ensure user feedback is incorporated at every phase?

**Project Manager:** How do we identify and address risks early, and escalate blockers efficiently?

**AI UX Engineer:** How do we maintain accessibility and prioritize UX improvements as features evolve?

**AI Agent Engineer:** How do we ensure agent actions remain explainable and traceable as new tools are added?

## Phase 3: Brainstorming Solutions

**Facilitator:** Let's brainstorm solutions to these challenges.

**Prompt Engineer:** Use traceability matrices and regular milestone reviews. Involve QA and business analysts in planning.

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** Establish versioning and rollback policies. Require error recovery validation in production.

**Senior Software Engineer:** Enforce test coverage thresholds, require interface documentation, and schedule technical debt reviews.

**Principal Architect:** Maintain living documentation, schedule onboarding sessions, and conduct regular governance reviews.

**Product Owner:** Map user stories to business objectives, schedule stakeholder reviews, and define clear success metrics.

**Project Manager:** Maintain a living risk register, schedule project health checks, and set up escalation processes.

**AI UX Engineer:** Schedule UX reviews, accessibility audits, and involve diverse users in testing.

**AI Agent Engineer:** Prioritize explainability, schedule agent-tool interaction reviews, and implement robust logging.

## Phase 4: Consensus-Building and Defining Milestones, Phases, and Steps

**Facilitator:** Let's work toward consensus on the best path forward and define the major milestones, phases, and steps.

**All SMEs:**
- Phase 1: Project Planning & Onboarding
- Phase 2: Architecture & Design
- Phase 3: Implementation
- Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
- Phase 6: Iteration & Improvement

Each phase includes:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Traceability from requirements to user stories and tasks
- Regular reviews and feedback loops
- Risk and technical debt management
- Documentation and onboarding updates
- Accessibility and user feedback integration

## Phase 5: Collaborative Definition of User Stories and Tasks

**Facilitator:** Let's flesh out the major user stories and break them into specific tasks.

**All SMEs:**
- User Story: As a developer, I want clear API contracts so I can integrate new tools without breaking changes.
  - Tasks: Document API contracts, implement versioning, write integration tests
- User Story: As a user, I want accessible workflows so I can use the system regardless of ability.
  - Tasks: Develop accessibility guidelines, conduct audits, gather user feedback
- User Story: As a product owner, I want traceability from requirements to implementation so I can ensure business objectives are met.
  - Tasks: Create traceability matrix, map user stories to requirements, review at each milestone
- User Story: As an SRE, I want robust monitoring and rollback so I can maintain system reliability.
  - Tasks: Implement monitoring, define rollback procedures, test error recovery
- User Story: As an agent engineer, I want explainable agent actions so I can debug and improve behaviors.
  - Tasks: Implement logging, schedule explainability reviews, document agent decisions

## Phase 6: Anti-Patterns, Blindspots, and Guidelines

**Facilitator:** Let's identify anti-patterns, code smells, and blindspots to avoid.

**All SMEs:**
- Skipping documentation or traceability reviews
- Rushing milestone definitions
- Failing to update risk registers or project plans
- Skipping accessibility audits or user feedback sessions
- Not logging agent actions or explainability reviews

Guidelines:
- Schedule regular reviews for documentation, risk, and technical debt
- Involve all relevant SMEs in planning and review phases
- Maintain traceability from requirements to implementation
- Prioritize accessibility, explainability, and user feedback
