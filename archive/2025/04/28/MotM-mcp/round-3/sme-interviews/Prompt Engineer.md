# Prompt Engineer SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that milestones are both actionable and traceable to requirements. Translating high-level requirements into granular, testable steps without losing intent or introducing ambiguity is difficult. There is also a risk of scope creep if milestones are not tightly defined.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Requirements drift during translation to user stories
- Misalignment between technical and business priorities
- Ensuring all compliance/privacy/legal requirements are mapped to actionable tasks

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would use a traceability matrix to map requirements to user stories and tasks. Each milestone would have clear acceptance criteria and be reviewed regularly. I would also involve compliance and security SMEs in all planning phases to ensure nothing is missed.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure traceability from requirements to implementation?
- What is the process for updating milestones as requirements evolve?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the granularity of milestones and the risk of requirements drift.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Rushing milestone definitions or skipping traceability reviews can lead to technical debt and missed requirements.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A dedicated QA Lead for milestone validation and a Business Analyst for requirements traceability.
