# AI UX Engineer SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that user experience and accessibility are embedded in every phase. There is a risk of overlooking edge cases in user needs and not allocating enough time for UX iteration.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Overlooking edge cases in user needs
- Insufficient time allocated for UX iteration
- Difficulty in gathering and integrating diverse user feedback

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would schedule regular UX reviews and accessibility audits, involve diverse users in testing, and ensure that each milestone includes user feedback loops and accessibility checks.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure accessibility is maintained as features evolve?
- What is the process for prioritizing UX improvements based on feedback?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the diversity of user needs and the speed of UX iteration.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Skipping accessibility audits or not involving real users in testing can lead to poor user experience.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
An Accessibility Specialist and a User Researcher.
