# Product Owner SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that each milestone delivers clear user value and aligns with business objectives. There is a risk of misalignment between technical deliverables and user needs if feedback loops are not tightly integrated.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Misalignment between technical deliverables and user value
- Insufficient user feedback integration
- Difficulty in prioritizing user stories as requirements evolve

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would map user stories directly to business objectives, schedule regular stakeholder and user reviews, and define success criteria for each milestone. The backlog would be reviewed and adjusted based on feedback and metrics.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure user feedback is incorporated at every phase?
- What is the process for reprioritizing the backlog as new needs emerge?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the integration of user feedback and the clarity of success metrics.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Skipping user reviews or failing to update success metrics can lead to features that do not deliver value.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A User Researcher and a Customer Success Manager.
