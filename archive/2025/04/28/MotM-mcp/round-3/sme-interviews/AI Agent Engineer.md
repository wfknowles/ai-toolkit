# AI Agent Engineer SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring agent behaviors remain testable and explainable as complexity increases. Tool integration and incremental rollout must be carefully managed to avoid regressions and maintain traceability.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Insufficient explainability for complex agent decisions
- Tool integration complexity as the system scales
- Difficulty in monitoring and logging agent actions

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would prioritize explainability in agent design, schedule regular reviews of agent-tool interactions, and implement robust monitoring and logging for traceability. Each phase would include incremental tool integration and explainability checks.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure agent actions remain explainable as new tools are added?
- What is the process for updating agent autonomy boundaries?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the scalability of agent-tool integration and the sufficiency of explainability measures.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Skipping explainability reviews or not logging agent actions can lead to opaque and unmanageable behaviors.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Machine Learning Engineer and a QA Engineer for agent workflows.
