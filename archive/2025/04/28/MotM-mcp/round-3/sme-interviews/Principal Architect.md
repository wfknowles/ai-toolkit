# Principal Architect SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring architectural consistency and scalability as the project grows. Defining governance and review processes for each phase is essential to prevent architectural drift and maintain alignment across teams.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Risks of architectural drift as teams scale
- Gaps in onboarding for new contributors
- Difficulty in maintaining living documentation

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would schedule regular architectural reviews, maintain living documentation, and establish clear versioning and deprecation policies. Each milestone would include onboarding updates and governance checks.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure new contributors are effectively onboarded?
- What is the process for updating architectural documentation as the system evolves?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around onboarding and the maintenance of documentation.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Neglecting documentation or skipping governance reviews can lead to misalignment and technical debt.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Documentation Specialist and a Governance Lead.
