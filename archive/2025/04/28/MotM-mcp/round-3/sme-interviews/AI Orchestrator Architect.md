# AI Orchestrator/Architect SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that orchestrator upgrades and workflow changes are backward compatible and do not disrupt existing processes. Defining clear state transition and error recovery plans for each phase is complex, especially as the system scales.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Backward compatibility during orchestrator upgrades
- Insufficient error logging for root cause analysis
- Complexity in modular workflow step registration

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would establish a versioning policy for orchestrator modules, require rollback plans for all workflow changes, and implement robust error propagation and recovery modules. Each phase would include validation of state handoff and rollback mechanisms.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure seamless upgrades without downtime?
- What is the process for validating error recovery in production?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around backward compatibility and the sufficiency of error logging.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Skipping rollback planning or failing to document API changes can lead to brittle workflows and technical debt.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Release Manager for orchestrator upgrades and a Reliability Engineer for error recovery validation.
