# Senior Software Engineer SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is maintaining code quality and test coverage as the project scales. Defining interfaces early is critical, but there is a risk of technical debt if rapid prototyping outpaces documentation and testing.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Technical debt accumulation during rapid development
- Insufficient test coverage for dynamic agent behaviors
- Coordination between teams on interface changes

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would enforce test coverage thresholds in CI, schedule regular technical debt reviews, and require interface documentation before implementation. Each phase would include code reviews and integration testing.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure interface changes are communicated and reviewed?
- What is the process for updating tests as requirements evolve?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the pace of technical debt accumulation and the sufficiency of integration tests.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Skipping tests or documentation to meet deadlines can lead to fragile code and future rework.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A dedicated Test Automation Engineer and a Documentation Specialist.
