# Project Manager SME Interview (Round 3)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that milestones are clearly defined, dependencies are documented, and risks are proactively managed. There is a risk of underestimating resource needs and not allocating enough time for risk mitigation.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Underestimating resource needs for later phases
- Gaps in risk identification and mitigation
- Communication breakdowns between teams

**3. If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?**
I would maintain a living risk register, schedule regular project health checks, and set up clear communication and escalation processes. Each milestone would include risk reviews and progress tracking.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we ensure risks are identified and addressed early?
- What is the process for escalating and resolving blockers?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around resource allocation and the effectiveness of risk management processes.

**6. Are there any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?**
Yes. Skipping risk reviews or failing to update the project plan can lead to missed deadlines and unmanaged risks.

**7. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Risk Manager and a Business Analyst.
