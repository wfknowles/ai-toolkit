# SME Group Interview – Facilitator Pre-Planning & Discussion Plan

## 1. Qualitative Analysis: Similarities & Differences

**Similarities:**
- All SMEs agree that state management and error handling are the core technical challenges.
- There is consensus that file-based state and prompt chaining are brittle and may not scale for complex workflows.
- Every SME highlights the importance of robust error recovery, user feedback, and clear UX.
- Most recommend a modular, extensible backend and clear separation of concerns.
- All see value in phased delivery: start with a fixed chain for MVP, then generalize.
- Security, reliability, and user trust are recurring themes.

**Differences:**
- Some SMEs (Prompt Engineer, AI Agent Engineer) focus more on prompt design and agent autonomy, while others (SSE, AOA) emphasize backend structure and testing.
- The Product Owner and AI UX Engineer are more concerned with user trust, transparency, and feedback mechanisms, while technical SMEs focus on implementation risks.
- There is some divergence on the necessity and form of intermediate artifacts/checkpoints.

## 2. Major Talking Points for Group Analysis
- How can we design a state management approach that is robust enough for multi-step workflows, given the constraints?
- What is the minimum viable error recovery and user feedback loop for the MVP?
- How do we balance automation (reduced friction) with transparency and user control?
- What is the best way to modularize prompts, tools, and agent logic for extensibility?
- How do we ensure security and reliability in a file-based, prompt-driven system?
- What are the most likely blockers for each phase, and how do we mitigate them?
- Which additional SMEs (Security, Test, Human Factors) should be included in future rounds?

## 3. Anticipated Conflicts or Disagreements
- The degree of automation vs. user control (especially regarding intermediate artifacts and checkpoints).
- The tradeoff between speed (fewer artifacts, more automation) and quality/robustness (more checkpoints, validation).
- The best format for state (JSON vs. Markdown) and how much structure is needed.
- How much agent autonomy is appropriate before user trust is impacted.

## 4. Group Conversation Plan
- Begin with a roundtable on the core technical challenge: state management and error recovery.
- Move to a discussion of UX: automation vs. transparency, and the role of intermediate artifacts.
- Explore modularity and extensibility: how to design for future tools, workflows, and agent behaviors.
- Address security, reliability, and the need for additional SME perspectives.
- Conclude with a consensus on the best path forward for the MVP and a list of open questions for future rounds.

# SME Group Interview – Meeting of the Minds Transcript

## Round 1: State Management and Error Recovery

**Facilitator:** Let's begin with the core technical challenge: state management and error recovery. Prompt Engineer, would you start us off?

**Prompt Engineer:** The biggest risk is that file-based state is fragile. If a tool call fails or the context window is exceeded, we could lose critical information. We need a lightweight, structured state object—ideally JSON—and robust validation at every step.

**Senior Software Engineer:** I agree. File writes aren't atomic, so we need to design for possible corruption. Every tool call should log its actions, and we should consider a backup or rollback mechanism for state files.

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** From an orchestration perspective, we should treat state as immutable between steps, writing new versions rather than overwriting. This allows us to recover from failures by reverting to the last good state. Error handling should be standardized, with clear propagation from tools to the agent and user.

**AI Agent Engineer:** The agent should validate all LLM-provided parameters before tool execution. If a tool fails, the agent should prompt the user for clarification or retry, rather than failing silently.

**Product Owner:** For the MVP, the minimum viable error recovery is clear user feedback and the ability to retry failed steps. We can add more sophisticated recovery later.

**Project Manager:** We should track error rates and recovery events as leading indicators of risk. Early integration tests are critical.

**AI UX Engineer:** User-facing error messages must be clear and actionable. If something goes wrong, the user should know what happened and what to do next.

## Round 2: Automation vs. Transparency and Intermediate Artifacts

**Facilitator:** Let's discuss the balance between automation and transparency, and the role of intermediate artifacts.

**AI UX Engineer:** Too much automation risks making the process a black box. Users need checkpoints—summaries or optional reviews—so they feel in control and can validate progress.

**Product Owner:** I agree. Removing all intermediate artifacts may speed things up, but we risk losing quality and user buy-in. For the MVP, let's make them optional or summarized, with clear progress updates.

**Prompt Engineer:** From a prompt design perspective, we can generate summaries or checkpoints as part of the chain, and prompt the user for confirmation at key steps.

**Senior Software Engineer:** Technically, generating and saving summaries is straightforward. The challenge is not exceeding the context window or cluttering the workspace.

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** We can modularize the chain so that each step outputs a summary and updates state. The orchestrator can decide when to prompt the user for review.

**AI Agent Engineer:** The agent should be able to pause and request user input if it detects ambiguity or a potential error.

## Round 3: Modularity, Extensibility, and Agent Autonomy

**Facilitator:** How do we best modularize prompts, tools, and agent logic for extensibility? And how much autonomy should the agent have?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** All tools and prompts should be defined in schemas, with clear interfaces. The orchestrator should be able to add or remove steps as needed. For future workflows, we can add new tools or agents without rewriting the core logic.

**Senior Software Engineer:** Dependency injection and a modular backend structure will make this easier to test and maintain. We should also design for future undo/rollback features.

**AI Agent Engineer:** Agent autonomy should be limited for actions that affect user files. For code insertions, always require user confirmation. For read-only actions, the agent can proceed autonomously.

**Product Owner:** User trust is paramount. Too much autonomy, especially for file changes, will erode trust. Always err on the side of transparency and control.

**AI UX Engineer:** We should provide clear indicators of agent actions and allow users to undo or review changes.

---

## Round 4: Security, Reliability, and Additional SME Perspectives

**Facilitator:** Let's address security, reliability, and the need for additional SME perspectives.

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** Workspace path validation and least-privilege execution are non-negotiable. All sensitive config should be handled via environment variables.

**Senior Software Engineer:** We need a Security Engineer to review file and tool access risks, and a Test Engineer for automated testing.

**Project Manager:** A DevOps or Release Manager should be involved for deployment and reliability planning.

**Product Owner:** A Compliance or Legal expert may be needed for regulatory review, especially if code modification features are used in enterprise settings.

**AI UX Engineer:** A Human Factors or Accessibility expert would help ensure the UX is inclusive and robust.

## Consensus and Path Forward

**Facilitator:** To conclude, what is the best path forward for the MVP?

**All SMEs (consensus):**
- Start with a fixed, modular chain for a specific concept type, focusing on robust state management, error recovery, and clear user feedback.
- Use JSON for state, with versioning and backup for recovery.
- Make intermediate artifacts optional or summarized, with user checkpoints at key steps.
- Require user confirmation for all file-changing actions.
- Involve additional SMEs (Security, Test, Human Factors) in future rounds.
- Track error rates, user feedback, and recovery events as key metrics.

**Open Questions for Future Rounds:**
- How do we best structure state for reliability and recovery?
- What are the limits of agent autonomy before user trust is impacted?
- How do we ensure extensibility for future tools, workflows, and agent behaviors?
- What are the most likely blockers for each phase, and how do we mitigate them?
- How do we best visualize code changes and context for non-expert users?
