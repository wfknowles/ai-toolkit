# Product Owner Pre-Analysis

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### User Value
- The MCP should deliver a seamless, low-friction coding assistant experience within Cursor IDE, minimizing manual steps (no copy/paste).
- Key value: reliable code Q&A and safe code insertion with user preview/confirmation.
- User trust is paramountâ€”clear feedback, undo, and error handling are essential.

### MVP Scope
- Focus on core workflows: reading files, answering questions, and inserting code snippets with confirmation.
- Defer advanced features (multi-file, multi-agent, advanced RAG) to post-MVP.
- Ensure robust error handling and clear user messaging from the start.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All MVP requirements and acceptance criteria (REQs, ACs) must be met.
- User must be able to:
  - Ask questions about the active file and get accurate answers.
  - Preview and confirm code insertions before changes are made.
  - Receive clear feedback on success/failure of actions.
- Setup and usage must be well-documented and easy to follow.

### Business Risks
- Poor UX (e.g., copy/paste, unclear errors) could undermine adoption.
- Security lapses (file access, API key handling) could create liability.
- Incomplete or unreliable tool behavior could erode user trust.

### Open Questions
- What metrics will best capture user satisfaction and agent reliability?
- How to prioritize feedback and iterate quickly post-MVP?
- Are there regulatory or compliance considerations for code modification features?
