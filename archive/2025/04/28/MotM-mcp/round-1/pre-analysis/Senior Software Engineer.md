# Senior Software Engineer Pre-Analysis

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### Implementation Feasibility
- The FastAPI backend and VSCode extension architecture is feasible and aligns with modern best practices.
- Async tool execution (aiofiles) and strict path validation are critical for reliability and security.
- Dockerization will simplify local deployment and testing.

### Code Structure
- Recommend a modular backend structure: `api/`, `core/`, `tools/`, `services/`, `tests/`.
- Use Pydantic models for API contracts and tool schemas.
- Implement Dependency Injection for testability.

### Testing & Quality
- Unit tests for all tool logic, especially file I/O and error handling.
- Integration tests for end-to-end agent workflows.
- Mock external dependencies (filesystem, Gemini API) in tests.
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated testing on PRs.

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between extension, backend, and tools.
- Use logging and observability for debugging and monitoring.
- Document configuration and setup thoroughly (README, .env).

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Handling edge cases in file operations and user input.
- Ensuring robust error handling and user feedback.
- Managing context window and prompt size limitations.

### Open Questions
- How to best structure tool schemas for future extensibility?
- What are the performance implications of large files or long conversations?
- How to support undo/rollback for code insertions?
