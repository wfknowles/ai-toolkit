## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### User Experience
- The primary UX goal is to eliminate copy/paste and minimize friction in agent interactions.
- The chat interface should feel native to Cursor IDE, with clear, responsive feedback for all actions.
- Code insertion must be previewed and confirmed by the user, with a clear diff and context display.

### Interface Design
- Use VSCode Webview for a modern, accessible chat UI.
- Display conversation history, agent status, and active file context.
- Provide clear indicators for backend connection and agent activity.

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Implement thumbs up/down or similar feedback on agent responses.
- Show success/failure messages for all tool actions.
- Allow users to undo code insertions if possible.

### Error Handling
- User-facing error messages must be clear, concise, and actionable (no jargon).
- Guide users through recovery steps when errors occur (retry, clarify, abort).
- Log user feedback and error events for continuous improvement.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Balancing automation with user control (especially for code changes).
- Ensuring accessibility and responsiveness in the UI.
- Designing for trustâ€”users must feel confident in agent actions.

### Open Questions
- What are the most common user pain points in current workflows?
- How to best visualize code changes and context for non-expert users?
- What onboarding or help features are needed for first-time users?
