# Project Manager Pre-Analysis

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### Project Planning
- The roadmap and requirements provide a clear phased approach (setup, integration, polish).
- Sprints should be short (1-2 weeks) with clear DoD for each milestone.
- Early focus on infrastructure, tool reliability, and API contract is critical.

### Risk Management
- Key risks: unclear requirements, integration issues between extension and backend, LLM context limitations, and security lapses.
- Mitigation: regular backlog grooming, early integration tests, security reviews, and clear documentation.
- Track error rates and user feedback as leading indicators of risk.

### Team Coordination
- Cross-functional collaboration (PE, AOA, SSE, UXE, AE) is essential for success.
- Regular standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure alignment.
- Encourage early and frequent feedback from all roles, especially on UX and error handling.

### Delivery Milestones
- Phase 1: Project setup, tool implementation, and API contract.
- Phase 2: Core workflow integration, agent logic, and UI/UX.
- Phase 3: MVP polish, documentation, and internal demo.
- Each phase should have clear acceptance criteria and demoable outputs.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Managing scope creep and prioritizing MVP features.
- Ensuring timely feedback loops between backend and frontend teams.
- Adapting to changes in LLM capabilities or API constraints.

### Open Questions
- What are the most likely blockers for each phase?
- How to best track and communicate progress to stakeholders?
- What is the escalation path for critical bugs or integration failures?
