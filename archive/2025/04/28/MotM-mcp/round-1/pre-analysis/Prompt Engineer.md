# Prompt Engineer Pre-Analysis

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### Prompt Design
- The MCP should leverage modular, composable prompts that can be dynamically constructed based on user intent, context, and tool invocation.
- Prompts must be structured to support function calling (Gemini Pro) and robust error handling, as outlined in the requirements.
- System prompts should clearly define agent persona, tool usage, and error handling policies.

### State Management
- State should be managed in a way that preserves conversation history, tool results, and user context (active file, selection) across turns.
- Consider using a lightweight state object passed between the extension and backend, avoiding persistent storage unless necessary for UX.

### Integration with Cursor IDE
- Since direct model API access is not possible, prompt servers must act as intermediaries, receiving context and user input from the IDE and returning agent responses.
- The extension should handle context gathering and pass it to the backend for prompt assembly.
- Avoid copy/paste by using the extension's API for code insertion and context retrieval.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Ensuring prompt reliability and clarity for function calling.
- Balancing prompt complexity with maintainability.
- Handling edge cases in tool invocation and error reporting.

### Open Questions
- How to best modularize prompts for extensibility?
- What are the limits of prompt size and context window in Gemini Pro?
- How to ensure seamless UX when agent actions require user confirmation (e.g., code insertion)?
