# AI Agent Engineer Pre-Analysis

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### Agent Logic
- The agent should follow a ReAct-style loop, parsing user queries, context, and history to determine actions.
- Must support Gemini function calling for tool invocation and handle both text and function call responses.
- Should validate LLM-provided parameters before tool execution to prevent errors.

### Autonomy & State
- The agent should manage its own state (conversation, tool results, context) across turns, ideally via a lightweight state object.
- Should be able to recover from errors by prompting the user for clarification or retrying failed steps.
- Autonomy should be balanced with user control, especially for actions like code insertion.

### Tool & State Integration
- Agent must integrate seamlessly with backend tool APIs (read_file, insert_code_snippet) and handle their results appropriately.
- Should format tool results for follow-up LLM calls and user feedback.
- Needs to handle tool errors gracefully and escalate to the user when necessary.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Ensuring reliable function calling and error handling in a multi-turn, multi-tool workflow.
- Managing context window limitations and prompt size.
- Designing for extensibility (adding new tools, workflows, or agent behaviors).

### Open Questions
- How to best structure agent state for reliability and recovery?
- What are the limits of agent autonomy before user trust is impacted?
- How to support future agent behaviors (e.g., multi-agent collaboration, advanced RAG)?
