# AI Orchestrator/Architect Pre-Analysis

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### System Architecture
- The MCP should be a modular, service-oriented backend (FastAPI, Dockerized) that mediates between the Cursor IDE extension and the Gemini LLM.
- All orchestration logic (prompt assembly, tool invocation, state management) should reside in the backend, with the extension acting as a thin client.
- Use Dependency Injection for testability and maintainability.

### Orchestration Flow
- The orchestrator should manage the ReAct loop: receive user input/context, assemble prompt, call Gemini, parse function calls, execute tools, and return results.
- Maintain a clear API contract (OpenAPI spec) for communication between extension and backend.
- Implement robust error handling and standardized ToolResult objects.

### Tool Integration
- Tools (read_file, insert_code_snippet) should be implemented as async, validated modules with clear schemas.
- Tool execution should be logged and monitored for observability.
- Tool schemas should be the single source of truth for both backend and prompt construction.

### Security
- Enforce strict workspace path validation and least-privilege execution.
- Securely handle API keys and sensitive config via environment variables.
- Avoid exposing unnecessary endpoints or data to the extension.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Ensuring statelessness or minimal state for scalability.
- Handling context window limitations in LLM calls.
- Designing for extensibility (adding new tools, workflows).

### Open Questions
- How to best manage conversation state across multiple turns?
- What are the best practices for error propagation from tools to the agent and user?
- How to support future multi-agent or multi-tool workflows elegantly?
