# AI UX Engineer SME Interview

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to the concept?**
Yes. The main challenge is delivering a smooth, low-friction UX while maintaining transparency and user control. Removing intermediate artifacts may reduce clutter but risks losing important checkpoints for validation and understanding.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Users may feel a loss of control or understanding if the process is too automated.
- Error handling and recovery must be clear and actionable, or users will be frustrated.
- The chat interface limits the types of feedback and onboarding we can provide.

**3. If you were to take this concept and bring it to fruition, how would your solution look like?**
I would design a chat interface with clear progress updates, optional checkpoints, and concise error messages. I would use summaries or collapsible sections for intermediate artifacts and provide onboarding/help features for new users.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the most common user pain points in current workflows?
- How do we best visualize code changes and context for non-expert users?
- What onboarding or help features are needed for first-time users?

**5. Does the current concept have any blindspots?**
Yes. There may be blindspots around accessibility, onboarding, and the balance between automation and user control.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Human Factors or Accessibility expert would be valuable for ensuring inclusivity and robust UX.
