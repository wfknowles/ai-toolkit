# Project Manager SME Interview

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to the concept?**
Yes. The main challenge is managing project risk and scope creep in a technically constrained environment. Reliance on prompt engineering and file I/O for orchestration is brittle and may lead to delays or failures.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Technical feasibility and brittleness of the chained prompt approach.
- Integration issues between the extension and backend.
- LLM context limitations and security lapses.

**3. If you were to take this concept and bring it to fruition, how would your solution look like?**
I would phase the project: first, design the core chain and state management; second, implement a basic fixed chain for the MVP; third, tackle generalization; and finally, refine error handling and output generation. I would ensure regular standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives for alignment.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the most likely blockers for each phase?
- How do we best track and communicate progress to stakeholders?
- What is the escalation path for critical bugs or integration failures?

**5. Does the current concept have any blindspots?**
Yes. There may be blindspots around artifact management, error recovery, and the need for internal state files even if user-facing artifacts are minimized.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A DevOps or Release Manager for deployment and reliability, and a Security Engineer for risk review, would be valuable.
