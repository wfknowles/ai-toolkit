# AI Agent Engineer SME Interview

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to the concept?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring reliable function calling and error handling in a multi-turn, multi-tool workflow, especially with context window limitations and prompt size constraints.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Managing agent state for reliability and recovery is difficult without persistent storage.
- Balancing agent autonomy with user trust and control, especially for code insertions.
- Handling tool errors gracefully and escalating to the user when necessary.

**3. If you were to take this concept and bring it to fruition, how would your solution look like?**
I would design the agent to follow a ReAct-style loop, validate all LLM-provided parameters, and manage state via a lightweight object. I would ensure robust error handling and clear user feedback, and design for extensibility to support future agent behaviors.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How to best structure agent state for reliability and recovery?
- What are the limits of agent autonomy before user trust is impacted?
- How to support future agent behaviors (e.g., multi-agent collaboration, advanced RAG)?

**5. Does the current concept have any blindspots?**
Yes. There may be blindspots around agent state management, error recovery, and the impact of autonomy on user trust.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Security Engineer for reviewing agent actions and a Human Factors expert for user trust and transparency would be valuable.
