# AI Orchestrator/Architect SME Interview

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to the concept?**
Yes. The main challenge is orchestrating a reliable, multi-step workflow using only prompt chaining and file-based state, especially given the lack of direct scripting or model API access. Ensuring robustness and recoverability in the face of tool or LLM errors is a significant concern.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Context window and prompt size limitations in Gemini Pro could truncate state or intermediate results.
- File I/O as the only state mechanism is brittle and may lead to data loss or corruption.
- Adapting the chain for different concepts (generalization) increases orchestration complexity.

**3. If you were to take this concept and bring it to fruition, how would your solution look like?**
I would implement a modular backend orchestrator (FastAPI, Dockerized) that manages the ReAct loop, tool invocation, and state. The orchestrator would use a standardized state schema (JSON) and robust error handling, with clear API contracts for the extension. I would also log all tool executions and state transitions for observability.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- How do we handle partial failures or retries in the chain?
- What is the best way to propagate errors from tools to the agent and user?
- How do we ensure extensibility for future workflows or tools?

**5. Does the current concept have any blindspots?**
Yes. There may be blindspots around error recovery, state consistency, and the scalability of file-based state. The process may also underestimate the complexity of generalizing the chain for diverse concepts.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A DevOps or Reliability Engineer could help address robustness and observability. A Security Engineer may also be needed to review file and tool access risks.
