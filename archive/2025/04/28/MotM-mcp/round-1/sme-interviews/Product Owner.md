# Product Owner SME Interview

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to the concept?**
Yes. The main challenge is balancing automation and reduced UX friction with the need for transparency, checkpoints, and quality control. Removing intermediate artifacts may speed things up but risks lower quality and less user buy-in.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Users may feel a loss of control or understanding if the process becomes a "black box."
- Error handling and recovery could be confusing or frustrating if not surfaced clearly.
- The process may not generalize well to all concept types without further tailoring.

**3. If you were to take this concept and bring it to fruition, how would your solution look like?**
I would start with a fixed chain for a specific concept type, focusing on UX improvement and clear user feedback. I would make intermediate artifacts optional or summarized, and provide progress updates and checkpoints for user review.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What metrics will best capture user satisfaction and agent reliability?
- How do we prioritize feedback and iterate quickly post-MVP?
- Are there regulatory or compliance considerations for code modification features?

**5. Does the current concept have any blindspots?**
Yes. There may be blindspots around user trust, quality control, and the adaptability of the process to different types of concepts or users.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Compliance or Legal expert may be needed for regulatory review, and a User Researcher could help with user feedback and satisfaction metrics.
