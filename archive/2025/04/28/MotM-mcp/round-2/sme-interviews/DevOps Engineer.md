# DevOps Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that deployment pipelines and infrastructure are as modular and reproducible as the application code. Defining clear strategies for environment management, secrets handling, and automated rollbacks is critical. There is also a challenge in aligning infrastructure-as-code practices with rapid MVP iteration cycles.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Environment drift: Keeping development, staging, and production environments consistent
- Security: Managing secrets and access controls securely across workflows
- Scalability: Ensuring infrastructure can scale with minimal manual intervention

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would implement CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, linting, and deployment gates. Infrastructure would be managed via code, with versioning and peer review. Monitoring and alerting would be set up from the start, and rollback procedures would be documented and tested.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the rollback and disaster recovery requirements for the MVP?
- How do we handle secrets rotation and access audits?
- What is the process for scaling infrastructure as usage grows?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around disaster recovery, secrets management, and the operational cost of scaling.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Security Engineer for in-depth review of access controls and a Site Reliability Engineer for high-availability and monitoring best practices.
