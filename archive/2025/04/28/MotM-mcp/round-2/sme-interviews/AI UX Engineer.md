# AI UX Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that user experience is prioritized alongside technical feasibility. Defining workflows that are intuitive for users, especially when interacting with AI-driven agents, requires close collaboration between design and engineering. There is also a challenge in prototyping and testing AI interactions quickly enough to inform design decisions.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Usability: Ensuring that AI-driven workflows are understandable and actionable for users
- Feedback: Gathering actionable user feedback on AI behaviors and iterating rapidly
- Accessibility: Making sure the MVP is usable by a diverse range of users

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would advocate for early and frequent user testing, with rapid prototyping of AI interactions. Design systems and guidelines would be established to ensure consistency. I would also work closely with engineering to ensure that user feedback is incorporated into each iteration.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the primary user personas and their goals?
- How do we measure the usability and satisfaction of AI-driven workflows?
- What is the process for iterating on UX based on user feedback?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around accessibility, the diversity of user needs, and the speed at which UX feedback can be incorporated.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
An Accessibility Specialist for inclusive design and a User Researcher for deeper insights into user needs.
