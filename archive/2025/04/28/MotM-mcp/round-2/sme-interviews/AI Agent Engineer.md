# AI Agent Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that agent behaviors are both robust and interpretable. Defining clear protocols for agent-tool interaction and state management is complex, especially as the number of tools and workflows grows. There is also a challenge in balancing agent autonomy with the need for predictable, testable outcomes.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Interpretability: Ensuring agent decisions are explainable to users and developers
- Tool integration: Managing the complexity of supporting many tools and APIs
- Testing: Creating reliable tests for dynamic, LLM-driven agent behaviors

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would implement a modular agent framework with standardized interfaces for tool adapters and state transitions. Logging and monitoring would be built in to support debugging and explainability. I would also prioritize test harnesses that simulate real-world agent workflows and edge cases.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the boundaries of agent autonomy for the MVP?
- How do we ensure agent actions are auditable and reversible?
- What is the process for updating agent logic as new tools are added?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the complexity of agent-tool interactions, the scalability of agent logic, and the challenges of maintaining explainability as the system evolves.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Machine Learning Engineer for advanced agent behaviors and a QA Engineer for comprehensive testing of agent workflows.
