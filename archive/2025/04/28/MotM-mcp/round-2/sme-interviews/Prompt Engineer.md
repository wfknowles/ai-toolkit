# Prompt Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that prompt templates are both modular and robust enough to handle diverse workflows without introducing ambiguity or context loss. Chaining prompts with explicit state handoff is powerful but fragile if state integrity is not strictly enforced.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Context window and prompt size limitations may restrict the complexity of chained workflows.
- Ensuring state integrity and validation at each step is non-trivial.
- Balancing extensibility with maintainability as new workflows are added.

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would start with a minimal set of prompt templates for the MVP, each with clear input/output contracts. I would implement state validation after each step and design prompts to generate summaries and checkpoints for user review.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What is the minimum viable set of prompt templates for the MVP?
- How do we ensure state integrity across chained steps?
- How do we handle prompt failures or ambiguous outputs?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around prompt ambiguity, state validation, and the scalability of the approach for more complex workflows.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Test Engineer for prompt validation and a Human Factors expert for user review checkpoints would be valuable.
