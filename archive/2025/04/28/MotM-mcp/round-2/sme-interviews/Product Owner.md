# Product Owner SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is aligning technical definitions with business value and user needs. There is often a gap between what is technically feasible and what delivers the most value to users. Prioritizing features for the MVP while ensuring a clear path for future enhancements is also challenging.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Balancing scope: Avoiding feature creep while ensuring the MVP is valuable
- Stakeholder alignment: Managing differing expectations and priorities
- User feedback: Ensuring rapid iteration based on real user input

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would focus on defining a clear MVP scope with measurable success criteria. Regular stakeholder reviews and user testing would be built into the process. I would also ensure that the product backlog is prioritized based on user value and technical feasibility, with clear documentation for each feature.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the critical user journeys for the MVP?
- How do we measure success for each workflow or feature?
- What is the feedback loop for incorporating user insights?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around user adoption risks, the clarity of MVP success metrics, and the process for handling changing requirements.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A User Researcher for deeper user insights and a Customer Success Manager to help bridge the gap between product and end users.
