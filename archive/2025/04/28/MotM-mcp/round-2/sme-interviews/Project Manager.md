# Project Manager SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of deliverables, timelines, and dependencies. Coordinating between technical and non-technical teams can be difficult, especially when requirements evolve rapidly. There is also a challenge in maintaining transparency and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Resource allocation: Balancing team capacity with project scope
- Change management: Handling evolving requirements without derailing progress
- Communication: Ensuring timely and clear updates across all teams

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would implement a project plan with clear milestones, deliverables, and risk assessments. Regular stand-ups and retrospectives would be used to maintain alignment. I would also use project management tools to track progress and dependencies, and ensure that change requests are documented and reviewed promptly.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the critical path items for MVP delivery?
- How do we handle scope changes and communicate them to stakeholders?
- What is the escalation process for blockers or risks?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around risk management, the impact of scope changes, and the effectiveness of communication channels.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Risk Manager for proactive risk identification and mitigation, and a Business Analyst to help translate requirements into actionable tasks.
