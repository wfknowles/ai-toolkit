# Test Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring comprehensive test coverage for both deterministic and non-deterministic (LLM-driven) behaviors. Defining testable requirements and automating tests for dynamic workflows is complex. There is also a challenge in balancing speed of delivery with the need for reliable, repeatable tests.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Test coverage: Ensuring all critical paths are tested, including edge cases
- Automation: Developing reliable automated tests for LLM-driven and agent-based workflows
- Maintenance: Keeping test suites up to date as the system evolves

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would implement a layered testing strategy: unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Test cases would be derived from user stories and edge cases. I would also advocate for test automation in CI/CD and regular test suite reviews to ensure relevance.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the acceptance criteria for MVP features?
- How do we validate LLM-driven outputs for correctness and safety?
- What is the process for updating tests as requirements change?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the validation of non-deterministic outputs, the scalability of test automation, and the process for test maintenance.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A QA Automation Specialist for advanced test automation and a User Acceptance Tester for real-world validation.
