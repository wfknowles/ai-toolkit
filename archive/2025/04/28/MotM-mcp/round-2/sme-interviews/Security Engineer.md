# Security Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that security is embedded from the start, not bolted on later. Defining secure defaults for data storage, access controls, and tool integration is complex, especially as the system evolves. There is also a challenge in balancing rapid MVP development with thorough security reviews.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Access control: Ensuring least-privilege access across all components
- Data protection: Securing sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Tool vetting: Assessing the security posture of third-party tools and APIs

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would implement role-based access controls, encrypted data storage, and regular security audits. All tool integrations would require security assessments, and secrets management would be automated. Security training for developers would be part of onboarding.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the compliance requirements for the MVP?
- How do we handle vulnerability disclosure and patching?
- What is the process for reviewing and approving new tool integrations?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around third-party tool risks, the speed of patching vulnerabilities, and the clarity of incident response plans.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Compliance Officer for regulatory requirements and a Privacy Engineer for data minimization and user consent.
