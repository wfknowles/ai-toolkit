# Senior Software Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that the codebase remains maintainable and testable as new tools and agent behaviors are added. Integrating LLM-driven logic with traditional software engineering practices (e.g., type safety, unit testing) can be difficult, especially when agent actions are dynamic. There is also a challenge in defining clear interfaces between the agent, orchestrator, and tool adapters to avoid tight coupling and facilitate future extensibility.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Ensuring robust error handling and recovery in a system where LLMs may produce unpredictable outputs
- Balancing rapid prototyping with the need for code quality and technical debt management
- Tool integration: supporting a growing set of tools without introducing regressions or breaking changes

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would advocate for a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns: agent logic, tool adapters, and state management should be modular. Automated tests (unit and integration) would be required for all new features. I would also implement static analysis and code linting as part of the CI pipeline. For tool integration, I would use interface contracts and versioning to minimize breaking changes.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What is the expected cadence for refactoring as the MVP evolves?
- How do we ensure that LLM-driven actions are auditable and traceable for debugging?
- What is the minimum set of tests required for MVP acceptance?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Potentially. There may be blindspots around technical debt accumulation, the complexity of tool integration, and the need for robust test coverage as the system grows.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A dedicated Test Engineer for designing and maintaining automated test suites, and a DevOps Engineer for CI/CD and deployment best practices.
