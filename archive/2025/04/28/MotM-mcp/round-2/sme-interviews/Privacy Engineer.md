# Privacy Engineer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring privacy by design in all workflows and data flows. Defining clear boundaries for data minimization, anonymization, and user consent is complex, especially as the MVP evolves. There is also a challenge in balancing usability with strong privacy controls.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Data minimization: Collecting only what is necessary for the MVP
- Anonymization: Ensuring data cannot be re-identified
- Consent management: Tracking and enforcing user preferences across workflows

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would implement privacy impact assessments for all new features, enforce data minimization at every step, and automate consent management. Anonymization techniques would be applied to all stored data, and regular privacy reviews would be conducted.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the user expectations for privacy in the MVP?
- How do we handle data deletion and portability requests?
- What is the process for updating privacy controls as requirements change?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the technical feasibility of anonymization, the scalability of consent management, and the process for ongoing privacy reviews.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Data Protection Officer for regulatory alignment and a Security Engineer for technical privacy controls.
