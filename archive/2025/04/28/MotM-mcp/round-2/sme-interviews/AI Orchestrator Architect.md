# AI Orchestrator/Architect SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The biggest challenge is ensuring the orchestrator is extensible and robust, especially with immutable state handoff and error propagation. Designing for recovery from partial failures and maintaining state consistency across steps is complex.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- State consistency and recovery from partial failures
- Standardizing error handling across diverse tools and steps
- Scaling the orchestrator to support new tools and workflows without major refactoring

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would implement a modular workflow engine with versioned state files, robust logging, and clear API contracts. Each workflow step would be a discrete module, and error handling would be standardized and logged for observability.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What is the minimum viable set of workflow steps for the MVP?
- How do we ensure state consistency and recovery from partial failures?
- How do we propagate errors from tools to the user in a user-friendly way?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around orchestrator extensibility, error propagation, and the complexity of supporting future workflows.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A DevOps or Reliability Engineer for deployment and monitoring, and a Security Engineer for reviewing tool and state access.
