# Principal Architect SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The primary challenge is architecting a system that is both scalable and adaptable to evolving requirements. Defining clear boundaries between orchestration, agent logic, and tool integration is critical. There is also a challenge in ensuring that architectural decisions made for the MVP do not create bottlenecks or technical debt as the system grows. Establishing standards for interoperability and documentation early is essential but often overlooked.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Scalability: Ensuring the architecture can handle increased load and complexity without major redesigns
- Interoperability: Integrating diverse tools and agents with minimal friction
- Governance: Maintaining architectural consistency as multiple teams contribute

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would design a service-oriented architecture with well-defined APIs and clear separation of concerns. Each component (orchestrator, agent, tool adapters) would be independently deployable and versioned. I would also establish architectural review checkpoints to ensure alignment as the MVP evolves. Documentation and onboarding guides would be prioritized to support future contributors.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the long-term scalability requirements beyond the MVP?
- How do we ensure architectural decisions remain flexible for future pivots?
- What is the process for deprecating or refactoring architectural components?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around long-term scalability, the complexity of maintaining interoperability, and the risks of architectural drift as the project grows.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Security Architect for reviewing data flows and access controls, and a Documentation Specialist to ensure architectural knowledge is captured and shared effectively.
