# Legal Advisor SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that all strategies and workflows are legally sound and do not expose the organization to undue risk. Defining clear terms of service, liability clauses, and intellectual property rights is complex, especially as the MVP evolves and new features are added.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Contractual clarity: Ensuring all agreements with users and partners are unambiguous
- Liability: Managing legal exposure from AI-driven decisions and outputs
- IP management: Protecting proprietary assets and respecting third-party rights

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would review all workflows and assets for legal compliance, draft clear user agreements, and establish processes for IP management. Regular legal reviews would be scheduled as the MVP evolves, and training would be provided to the team on legal considerations.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the key legal risks associated with the MVP?
- How do we handle disputes or claims arising from AI outputs?
- What is the process for updating legal documents as features change?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around liability for AI decisions, the scope of IP protection, and the process for legal change management.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Risk Manager for operational risk assessment and a Compliance Officer for regulatory alignment.
