# Compliance Officer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that all assets, workflows, and data handling practices comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Defining clear data retention, consent, and audit processes is complex, especially as the MVP evolves. There is also a challenge in keeping compliance documentation up to date with rapid development cycles.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Regulatory scope: Navigating overlapping or conflicting requirements
- Documentation: Maintaining accurate records of compliance activities
- Change management: Ensuring compliance as features and workflows change

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would establish a compliance matrix mapping features to regulatory requirements, implement automated compliance checks where possible, and require regular audits. All changes would be reviewed for compliance impact, and training would be provided to the team.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the primary regulatory frameworks that apply to the MVP?
- How do we document and track user consent and data processing activities?
- What is the process for handling data subject requests?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around cross-border data transfers, the granularity of consent tracking, and the process for responding to regulatory changes.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Privacy Engineer for technical implementation of compliance controls and a Legal Advisor for interpreting regulatory requirements.
