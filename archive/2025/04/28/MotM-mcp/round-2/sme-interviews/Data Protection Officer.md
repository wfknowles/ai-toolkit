# Data Protection Officer SME Interview (Round 2)

**1. Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?**
Yes. The main challenge is ensuring that all data processing activities are compliant with data protection laws and best practices. Defining clear data flows, retention policies, and user rights management is complex, especially as the MVP evolves. There is also a challenge in maintaining up-to-date records of processing activities.

**2. Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?**
- Data mapping: Accurately documenting all data flows and processing activities
- User rights: Implementing robust mechanisms for data access, correction, and deletion
- Regulatory change: Adapting to evolving data protection laws

**3. If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?**
I would establish a data inventory and regularly update records of processing activities. User rights management would be automated where possible, and regular audits would be conducted. Training for all staff on data protection principles would be mandatory.

**4. Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?**
- What are the data retention and deletion policies for the MVP?
- How do we ensure transparency with users about data processing?
- What is the process for responding to data breaches?

**5. Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?**
Possibly. There may be blindspots around the completeness of data mapping, the effectiveness of user rights management, and the speed of breach response.

**6. Do you believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?**
A Legal Advisor for interpreting new regulations and a Security Engineer for technical enforcement of data protection controls.
