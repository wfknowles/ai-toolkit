# Principal Architect Pre-Analysis (Round 2)

## Initial Thoughts on Assets, Strategies, and Workflows for MCP MVP

### Key Assets Needed
- High-level architecture diagrams (system, data, workflow)
- Modular service definitions (backend, extension, tools)
- State and tool schemas (JSON, OpenAPI)
- Security and compliance documentation

### Strategies
- Design for separation of concerns: clear boundaries between orchestrator, agent, tools, and UI
- Use event-driven or stepwise workflow orchestration for extensibility
- Plan for scalability and maintainability from the outset

### Methodologies
- Architecture review sessions with all stakeholders
- Threat modeling and security reviews
- Documentation-first approach for APIs and workflows

### Workflows
- Orchestrated workflow: input → SME simulation → group synthesis → requirements/roadmap
- Each step is a discrete service or module, communicating via well-defined interfaces
- Versioned state and audit logs for traceability

### Open Questions
- How to best balance flexibility (for future workflows) with MVP simplicity?
- What are the architectural tradeoffs between synchronous and asynchronous orchestration?
- How to ensure compliance and auditability from the start?
