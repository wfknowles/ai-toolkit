# Senior Software Engineer Pre-Analysis (Round 2)

## Initial Thoughts on Assets, Strategies, and Workflows for MCP MVP

### Key Assets Needed
- Modular backend codebase (FastAPI, Pydantic, aiofiles)
- Comprehensive unit and integration test suites
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- State schema (JSON) and tool schemas (Pydantic models)

### Strategies
- Test-driven development for all backend logic and tool implementations
- Use dependency injection for testability and maintainability
- Implement versioned state files and backup/rollback mechanisms

### Methodologies
- Code reviews and pair programming for critical components
- Continuous integration with automated test coverage
- Logging and observability for debugging and monitoring

### Workflows
- Stepwise execution: input → SME simulation → group synthesis → requirements/roadmap
- Each step reads/writes state, with validation and error handling
- User checkpoints and rollback options at key stages

### Open Questions
- How to ensure atomicity and consistency of state updates?
- What is the minimum viable set of tests for the MVP?
- How to support extensibility for future tools and workflows?
