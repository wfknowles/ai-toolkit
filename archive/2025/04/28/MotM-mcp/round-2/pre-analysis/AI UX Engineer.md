# AI UX Engineer Pre-Analysis (Round 2)

## Initial Thoughts on Assets, Strategies, and Workflows for MCP MVP

### Key Assets Needed
- UX wireframes and user journey maps for all core workflows
- Feedback and error messaging templates
- Accessibility guidelines and checklists

### Strategies
- Design for minimal friction: clear progress indicators, user checkpoints, and undo/rollback options
- Prioritize accessibility and inclusivity from the start
- Use user testing and feedback to iterate on UI/UX

### Methodologies
- Rapid prototyping and usability testing
- Accessibility audits and reviews
- Continuous user feedback collection (in-app, post-action)

### Workflows
- User journey: concept input → SME simulation → group synthesis → requirements/roadmap
- User checkpoints after major steps for validation and feedback
- Error handling and recovery flows mapped for all critical actions

### Open Questions
- What are the most common user pain points in current workflows?
- How to best visualize code changes and context for non-expert users?
- What onboarding or help features are needed for first-time users?
