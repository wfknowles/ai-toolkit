# AI Orchestrator/Architect Pre-Analysis (Round 2)

## Initial Thoughts on Assets, Strategies, and Workflows for MCP MVP

### Key Assets Needed
- Orchestrator backend (FastAPI, Dockerized) with modular workflow engine
- State schema (JSON) for passing context, results, and workflow status
- Tool schemas for all supported actions (read_file, insert_code_snippet, etc.)
- API contract (OpenAPI spec) for extension-backend communication

### Strategies
- Immutable state handoff between workflow steps (versioned state files)
- Standardized error handling and propagation from tools to agent/user
- Logging and observability for all tool executions and state transitions

### Methodologies
- Test-driven development for orchestrator and tool logic
- Integration testing for end-to-end workflow execution
- Continuous integration pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### Workflows
- Stepwise execution: receive input → run SME simulation → synthesize group output → generate requirements/roadmap
- Each step reads previous state, performs its task, writes new state, and logs results
- User checkpoints and error recovery at defined workflow stages

### Open Questions
- How to best structure the orchestrator for extensibility (adding new tools/steps)?
- What is the minimum viable set of workflow steps for the MVP?
- How to ensure state consistency and recovery from partial failures?
