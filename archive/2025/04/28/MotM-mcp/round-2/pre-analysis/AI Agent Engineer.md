# AI Agent Engineer Pre-Analysis (Round 2)

## Initial Thoughts on Assets, Strategies, and Workflows for MCP MVP

### Key Assets Needed
- Agent logic modules for ReAct-style loop and function calling
- State management utilities for conversation, tool results, and context
- Tool integration adapters (read_file, insert_code_snippet, etc.)

### Strategies
- Validate all LLM-provided parameters before tool execution
- Design agent to prompt user for clarification or retry on errors
- Modularize agent behaviors for extensibility (future tools, multi-agent, advanced RAG)

### Methodologies
- Unit and integration testing for agent logic and tool integration
- Continuous monitoring of agent actions and error rates
- User feedback loop for agent performance and trust

### Workflows
- Agent-driven workflow: parse input → determine action → invoke tool → handle result → update state
- User confirmation required for file-changing actions
- Error handling and recovery at each step

### Open Questions
- How to best structure agent state for reliability and recovery?
- What are the limits of agent autonomy before user trust is impacted?
- How to support future agent behaviors and workflows?
