# Project Manager Pre-Analysis (Round 2)

## Initial Thoughts on Assets, Strategies, and Workflows for MCP MVP

### Key Assets Needed
- Detailed project roadmap and milestone plan
- Risk register and mitigation strategies
- Communication plan for stakeholders and team
- Definition of Done (DoD) and acceptance criteria for all deliverables

### Strategies
- Phase the project: core workflow MVP first, then generalization and advanced features
- Regular backlog grooming and sprint planning
- Early integration and end-to-end testing to catch issues early

### Methodologies
- Agile (Scrum or Kanban) with short sprints and regular retrospectives
- Continuous risk assessment and adjustment
- Cross-functional standups and reviews

### Workflows
- Stepwise project execution: requirements → design → implementation → testing → review
- Regular checkpoints for progress and risk review
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement

### Open Questions
- What are the most likely blockers for each phase?
- How to best track and communicate progress to stakeholders?
- What is the escalation path for critical bugs or integration failures?
