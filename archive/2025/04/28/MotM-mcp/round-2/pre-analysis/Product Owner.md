# Product Owner Pre-Analysis (Round 2)

## Initial Thoughts on Assets, Strategies, and Workflows for MCP MVP

### Key Assets Needed
- Clear user stories and acceptance criteria for all MVP features
- Requirements and roadmap documents (living, versioned)
- User feedback mechanisms (in-app, post-action)

### Strategies
- Prioritize core workflows: file reading, Q&A, code insertion with confirmation
- Define MVP scope tightly; defer advanced features to future rounds
- Ensure robust error handling and clear user messaging from the start

### Methodologies
- Agile development with short sprints and regular reviews
- Continuous user feedback and rapid iteration
- Definition of Done (DoD) checklist for all deliverables

### Workflows
- User journey: concept input → SME simulation → group synthesis → requirements/roadmap
- User checkpoints after major steps for validation and feedback
- Feedback loop for post-MVP improvements

### Open Questions
- What metrics will best capture user satisfaction and agent reliability?
- How to prioritize and incorporate user feedback post-MVP?
- Are there compliance or legal considerations for code modification features?
