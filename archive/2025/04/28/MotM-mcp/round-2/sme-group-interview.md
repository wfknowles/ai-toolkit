# MotM-mcp Round 2 SME Group Interview

## Phase 1: Group Analysis of Insights

**Facilitator:** Welcome, everyone. Let's begin by sharing our perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of the insights from your individual interviews. 

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** The modular workflow engine and standardized error handling are strong points. However, extensibility and error propagation remain complex, especially as we scale.

**Senior Software Engineer:** I agree. The emphasis on modularity and testability is crucial, but integrating LLM-driven logic with traditional practices is still a challenge. We need clearer interface contracts.

**Principal Architect:** Architectural drift and long-term scalability are my main concerns. Early documentation and review checkpoints are essential.

**Product Owner:** Aligning technical feasibility with user value is a recurring challenge. We must avoid feature creep while ensuring the MVP is valuable.

**Project Manager:** Transparency and accountability are key. Resource allocation and change management need more robust processes.

**AI UX Engineer:** User experience must be prioritized. Rapid prototyping and feedback loops are necessary, but accessibility and diversity of user needs are often overlooked.

**AI Agent Engineer:** Interpretability and testability of agent behaviors are critical. Tool integration and agent autonomy boundaries need clearer definitions.

**DevOps Engineer:** Environment consistency and secrets management are pain points. Infrastructure-as-code must keep pace with rapid iteration.

**Security Engineer:** Security must be embedded from the start. Tool vetting and access controls are ongoing challenges.

**Site Reliability Engineer:** Observability and actionable monitoring are often underdeveloped. SLIs and SLOs should be defined early.

**Test Engineer:** Comprehensive test coverage, especially for LLM-driven behaviors, is difficult. Automation and maintenance of test suites are ongoing concerns.

**Compliance Officer:** Keeping compliance documentation current is challenging. Regulatory scope and consent tracking need more attention.

**Privacy Engineer:** Privacy by design is essential. Data minimization and anonymization must be enforced at every step.

**Data Protection Officer:** Data mapping and user rights management are complex. Regular audits and training are necessary.

**Legal Advisor:** Legal clarity on liability, IP, and contracts is critical. Regular legal reviews and training are needed.

## Phase 2: Discussion of Challenges and Unknowns

**Facilitator:** Let's discuss the specific challenges and unknowns. Where do you see the biggest risks or gaps?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** State consistency and error recovery are still not fully solved. How do we propagate errors in a user-friendly way?

**Senior Software Engineer:** How do we ensure LLM-driven actions are auditable and traceable?

**Principal Architect:** What is the process for deprecating or refactoring architectural components?

**Product Owner:** How do we measure success for each workflow or feature?

**Project Manager:** What is the escalation process for blockers or risks?

**AI UX Engineer:** How do we measure usability and satisfaction of AI-driven workflows?

**AI Agent Engineer:** What are the boundaries of agent autonomy for the MVP?

**DevOps Engineer:** What are the rollback and disaster recovery requirements?

**Security Engineer:** How do we handle vulnerability disclosure and patching?

**Site Reliability Engineer:** What are the reliability targets for the MVP?

**Test Engineer:** How do we validate LLM-driven outputs for correctness and safety?

**Compliance Officer:** How do we document and track user consent and data processing activities?

**Privacy Engineer:** How do we handle data deletion and portability requests?

**Data Protection Officer:** What are the data retention and deletion policies?

**Legal Advisor:** How do we handle disputes or claims arising from AI outputs?

## Phase 3: Brainstorming Solutions

**Facilitator:** Let's brainstorm solutions to these challenges.

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** Modular, versioned state files and robust logging for traceability. Standardized error contracts.

**Senior Software Engineer:** Automated tests and static analysis for all new features. Interface contracts for tool integration.

**Principal Architect:** Service-oriented architecture with independent, versioned components. Architectural review checkpoints.

**Product Owner:** Clear MVP scope with measurable success criteria. Regular stakeholder reviews and user testing.

**Project Manager:** Project plan with milestones, deliverables, and risk assessments. Use of project management tools.

**AI UX Engineer:** Early and frequent user testing, rapid prototyping, and design systems for consistency.

**AI Agent Engineer:** Modular agent framework, logging, and test harnesses for real-world scenarios.

**DevOps Engineer:** CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and automated monitoring/alerting.

**Security Engineer:** Role-based access controls, encrypted storage, and regular security audits.

**Site Reliability Engineer:** SLIs/SLOs, actionable monitoring, and incident response procedures.

**Test Engineer:** Layered testing strategy and automation in CI/CD.

**Compliance Officer:** Compliance matrix, automated checks, and regular audits.

**Privacy Engineer:** Privacy impact assessments, data minimization, and automated consent management.

**Data Protection Officer:** Data inventory, automated user rights management, and regular audits.

**Legal Advisor:** Regular legal reviews, clear user agreements, and IP management processes.
