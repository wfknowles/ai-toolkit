# MotM-mcp Round 3: Master Roadmap

## Milestones, Phases, and Steps

### Phase 1: Project Planning & Onboarding
- Review requirements and project charter
- Onboard team members
- Establish traceability matrix
- Acceptance Criteria: All team members onboarded, requirements mapped to initial user stories
- Guidelines: Involve all SMEs in planning; document onboarding process

### Phase 2: Architecture & Design
- Finalize architecture and interfaces
- Update architectural diagrams and documentation
- Define governance and review processes
- Acceptance Criteria: Architecture diagrams approved, interfaces documented
- Guidelines: Schedule regular architectural reviews; maintain living documentation

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Develop orchestrator, agent framework, tool adapters, CI/CD, security modules
- Implement versioning and rollback policies
- Acceptance Criteria: Core modules pass integration tests, versioning in place
- Guidelines: Require interface documentation before implementation; enforce test coverage thresholds

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Unit, integration, end-to-end, and compliance testing
- Conduct code reviews and technical debt assessments
- Acceptance Criteria: All critical paths tested, technical debt reviewed
- Guidelines: Schedule regular technical debt reviews; involve QA and business analysts

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
- Deploy MVP, set up monitoring, incident response, and feedback loops
- Implement robust logging and rollback procedures
- Acceptance Criteria: MVP deployed, monitoring and rollback tested
- Guidelines: Test error recovery in production; maintain a living risk register

### Phase 6: Iteration & Improvement
- Incorporate user feedback, address technical debt, refine features
- Review and adjust backlog based on feedback and metrics
- Acceptance Criteria: User feedback integrated, backlog updated
- Guidelines: Schedule regular UX reviews and accessibility audits; involve diverse users in testing

## User Stories and Tasks

### 1. As a developer, I want clear API contracts so I can integrate new tools without breaking changes.
- Tasks:
  - Document API contracts
  - Implement versioning
  - Write integration tests
- Code Example:
```python
# Example: Versioned API contract (Python)
class ToolAdapterV1:
    def execute(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
        pass  # Implementation
```

### 2. As a user, I want accessible workflows so I can use the system regardless of ability.
- Tasks:
  - Develop accessibility guidelines
  - Conduct accessibility audits
  - Gather user feedback
- Diagram:
```
[User] -> [Accessible UI] -> [Workflow Engine] -> [Result]
```

### 3. As a product owner, I want traceability from requirements to implementation so I can ensure business objectives are met.
- Tasks:
  - Create traceability matrix
  - Map user stories to requirements
  - Review at each milestone
- Code Example:
```yaml
# Example: Traceability matrix (YAML)
requirement: "REQ-001"
user_story: "US-001"
task: "Implement API contract for tool integration"
```

### 4. As an SRE, I want robust monitoring and rollback so I can maintain system reliability.
- Tasks:
  - Implement monitoring
  - Define rollback procedures
  - Test error recovery
- Diagram:
```
[Service] -> [Monitoring] -> [Alerting]
         -> [Rollback Handler]
```

### 5. As an agent engineer, I want explainable agent actions so I can debug and improve behaviors.
- Tasks:
  - Implement logging
  - Schedule explainability reviews
  - Document agent decisions
- Code Example:
```python
# Example: Logging agent actions
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("agent")
def agent_action(action, context):
    logger.info(f"Action: {action}, Context: {context}")
```

## Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, and Guidelines (Summary)
- Each phase and user story must have clear acceptance criteria
- Maintain traceability from requirements to implementation
- Schedule regular reviews for documentation, risk, and technical debt
- Involve all relevant SMEs in planning and review phases
- Prioritize accessibility, explainability, and user feedback
- Test error recovery and rollback procedures in production
- Maintain living documentation and onboarding materials
