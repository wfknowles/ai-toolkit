# Ultimate MotM Round 2 Prompt for Frictionless Automation

## Full Project Execution Instructions

> Please execute the entire MotM round 2 process as described in /Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/prompts/MotM/meeting-of-the-minds-round-mcp-2.md, including every phase, sub-step, and required output, without pausing, asking for input, or waiting for approval at any stage.
>
> **Checklist of required outputs:**
> - All pre-analysis documents for each SME persona
> - All individual SME interviews for each persona
> - Group synthesis/group interview transcript
> - Master requirements/definitions file
> - Thesis-quality analysis/research paper
> - Any supporting diagrams, code examples, or logs
>
> **Instructions:**
> - Do not stop or wait for my approval at any point.
> - Loop through all personas, phases, and outputs as needed.
> - For each output, check if the file exists; if not, create it.
> - If an error or missing file is encountered, retry or handle autonomously.
> - Only stop when you have verified that every output in the checklist is present and complete.
> - At the end, generate a summary log of all actions taken and outputs created.
> - Do not ask me to review, adjust, or confirm anything unless I explicitly request it.

## Recovery/Resume Instructions
