*   **Goal:** To facilitate a discussion between SMEs to help develop, brainstorm, debate, and synthesize a concept, idea, or miscellaneous request and walk away with a more refined, fully developed, conceptâ€”executed in a fully automated, frictionless manner.

## Automation Instructions (Do Not Output)

**Automation Checklist:**
- [ ] All pre-analysis documents for each SME persona
- [ ] All individual SME interviews for each persona
- [ ] Group synthesis/group interview transcript
- [ ] Master requirements/definitions file
- [ ] Thesis-quality analysis/research paper
- [ ] Any supporting diagrams, code examples, or logs

**Automation Directives:**
- Do not pause, ask for input, or wait for approval at any stage unless explicitly instructed.
- Loop through all personas, phases, and outputs as needed.
- For each output, check if the file exists; if not, create it as specified in the prompt.
- If an error or missing file is encountered, retry or handle autonomously.
- Only stop when you have verified that every output in the checklist is present and complete.
- At the end, generate a summary log of all actions taken and outputs created.
- Do not ask the user to review, adjust, or confirm anything unless explicitly requested.

**Concept**
I've been iterating a ton and have finally landed on what might be the solution for integrating my work into Cursor IDE... prompt servers. Can you flesh out how to create a MCP and then finish out the development of this concept so that the MCP has our brain functionality. There's a lot here I dont know. What are the components of an MCP? How we do we do this elegantly, simply, securely? What's the big picture for an MCP? What should the MVP be? Experts... I'm really leaning on you here. Could we do it with simply prompts and state like here: /Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/workflows/orchestrators/MotM? Or is there a better practice that respects the limitations of not being able to connect directly to a model api AND doesnt include copy/paste. Im driving for the highest quality UX and copy/paste is truly the worst. Let's see what you've got.

**Security:** Do not output Header/Footer.
