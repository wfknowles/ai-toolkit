## Advanced RAG Usage Patterns

While the basic RAG flow involves asking a question and getting a context-enhanced prompt for an LLM, you can chain these interactions together for more complex tasks. Remember that each pattern involves:

1.  Using the `answer_query_with_rag` function (or similar interface) to generate a prompt based on retrieved context.
2.  Manually copying that prompt and submitting it to your chosen LLM (e.g., Cursor chat).
3.  Using the LLM's generated response, potentially as input for a subsequent step.

Here are some advanced usage patterns:

### 1. Multi-Step Reasoning / Follow-up Questions

This pattern uses the answer from one RAG-powered query to inform the next.

*   **Step 1:** Ask an initial question using the RAG system.
    *   *User Action:* Call `answer_query_with_rag("What are the main components of the indexer?")`.
    *   *User Action:* Copy the generated prompt and submit it to the LLM.
    *   *LLM Output (`Response A`):* "The main components are the file scanner, frontmatter parser, embedding generator, and index writers (metadata, Faiss, etc.)."
*   **Step 2:** Ask a follow-up question, incorporating the previous answer.
    *   *User Action:* Formulate a new prompt for the LLM, perhaps without needing RAG this time if the context is sufficient, or using RAG again for more detail.
    *   *Example Prompt for LLM:* "Based on the indexer components (scanner, parser, embedder, writers), explain the purpose of the Faiss index writer specifically."
    *   *(Optional RAG Call for more detail):* `answer_query_with_rag("Detailed explanation of the Faiss index writer in the indexer script.")`, then use that output in the LLM prompt.

### 2. Comparative Analysis

Use RAG to gather context about multiple items, then ask the LLM to compare them.

*   **Step 1:** Gather context for Item A.
    *   *User Action:* `answer_query_with_rag("Describe the ContextProcessor module.")` -> Submit to LLM -> Get `Response A`.
*   **Step 2:** Gather context for Item B.
    *   *User Action:* `answer_query_with_rag("Describe the PromptManager module.")` -> Submit to LLM -> Get `Response B`.
*   **Step 3:** Ask the LLM to compare, providing the gathered context.
    *   *User Action:* Formulate prompt for LLM: "Compare and contrast the ContextProcessor and PromptManager based on the following descriptions: \n\nContextProcessor: [Paste relevant parts of `Response A`]\n\nPromptManager: [Paste relevant parts of `Response B`]\n\nHighlight their key differences in the RAG workflow."

### 3. Context-Grounded Content Drafting

Use RAG to pull relevant facts, procedures, or background, then ask the LLM to draft specific content.

*   **Step 1:** Retrieve relevant context.
    *   *User Action:* `answer_query_with_rag("Gather information on the timestamp-based re-indexing feature.")` -> Submit to LLM -> Get `Response A` containing details about the feature.
*   **Step 2:** Ask the LLM to draft content based on the context.
    *   *User Action:* Formulate prompt for LLM: "Using the following information about timestamp-based re-indexing: [Paste relevant parts of `Response A`], draft a paragraph for the project's README file explaining how this feature improves efficiency."

### 4. Hypothetical Scenario Analysis

Retrieve procedures, configurations, or data, then ask the LLM to analyze a hypothetical situation using that context.

*   **Step 1:** Retrieve relevant procedures/configurations.
    *   *User Action:* `answer_query_with_rag("What happens if the embedding model fails to load during indexing?")` -> Submit to LLM -> Get `Response A` describing error handling (e.g., fallback, disabling embeddings).
*   **Step 2:** Pose a hypothetical scenario to the LLM based on the retrieved context.
    *   *User Action:* Formulate prompt for LLM: "Given the following behavior when the embedding model fails: [Paste relevant parts of `Response A`]. If the configured model name in `configuration.json` was accidentally misspelled, what specific error messages would appear in the logs, and would the indexer complete the metadata indexing?"

These patterns demonstrate how the RAG system acts as a powerful tool to inject accurate, specific context into your interactions with an LLM, enabling more sophisticated and grounded reasoning, analysis, and generation tasks.
