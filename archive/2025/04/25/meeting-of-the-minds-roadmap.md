# Meeting of the Minds III: Project Planning and Roadmap for a File-Based AI Brain

**Date:** 2024-04-25 (Simulated)
**Participants (Simulated Personas):** Project Facilitator, Project Manager (PM), Product Owner (PO), Machine Learning Engineer (MLE), Prompt Engineer (PE), AI Orchestrator/Architect (AIOA), Senior Software Engineer (SSE), Principal Architect (PA)
**References:** 
*   Meeting of the Minds I Report (`meeting-of-the-minds.md`)
*   Meeting of the Minds II Report (`meeting-of-the-minds-reqs.md`)
*   Requirements Specification (`requirements.md`)
**Subject:** Developing a project plan, roadmap, and user stories based on the defined requirements for the file-based AI brain, while identifying potential risks and blindspots.

## 1. Introduction

Building upon the defined strategy and implementation specifications from the previous two "Meeting of the Minds" sessions, this third meeting focused on project execution planning. A group including project management and product ownership perspectives, alongside the technical experts, convened to translate the detailed requirements (`requirements.md`) into a structured roadmap. The primary goals were to establish project phases, identify potential blindspots missed in earlier analyses, review key technical decisions for risks or anti-patterns, and define initial user stories and tasks to guide development.

## 2. Foundational Documents Review

The session commenced with a review of the three key artifacts produced previously:

1.  **`meeting-of-the-minds.md`:** Outlined the initial strategy favoring metadata, indexing, and a retrieval module.
2.  **`meeting-of-the-minds-reqs.md`:** Summarized the second meeting where implementation details (schemas, APIs, CLI) were defined.
3.  **`requirements.md`:** Provided the detailed technical specification for components like YAML frontmatter, the JSON index, the indexer script, and the retrieval module.

This review ensured all participants shared a common understanding of the agreed-upon technical design.

## 3. Expert Analysis: Phasing, Risks, and Blindspots

Individual consultations were simulated to gather diverse perspectives on project planning and potential issues:

*   **PM:** Proposed a clear phasing (R1: Core Metadata, R2: Semantics) with specific milestones (1a-1d, 2a-2d), highlighting the need to define the indexer trigger mechanism and manage dependencies.
*   **PO:** Confirmed the value proposition of R1, questioned the immediate necessity of R2 (semantic search) from a user perspective, and raised concerns about the knowledge contribution user experience and the sufficiency/necessity of mandatory frontmatter fields.
*   **MLE:** Focused on R2 feasibility, noting the need for semantic evaluation metrics, potential Faiss scalability issues (`IndexFlatL2` limits), and the anti-pattern of storing large ML artifacts in git.
*   **PE:** Discussed prompt template management, versioning, and the critical need for defining the logic to handle retrieved context that exceeds LLM limits (summarization/snippeting).
*   **AIOA:** Stressed the importance of defining the indexer trigger/workflow and addressing potential concurrency issues between the indexer and the agent reading the index. Recommended clear error propagation from the retrieval module.
*   **SSE:** Emphasized testing strategies (esp. file system interactions using `pyfakefs`), robust error handling, logging standards (JSON to stdout), and dependency version pinning (`requirements.txt`).
*   **PA:** Reiteration of the inherent scalability limits of the file-based approach and the need to document assumptions (like non-concurrent access) and consider future migration paths. Highlighted the importance of observability.

**Key Blindspots/Risks Identified:**

1.  **Indexer Trigger/Scheduling:** How and when the `indexer.py` script runs.
2.  **Concurrency:** Assumption of non-concurrent index access needs documentation and potential future mitigation.
3.  **Knowledge Management UX:** Ease of adding/editing knowledge and ensuring metadata quality.
4.  **Semantic Search Evaluation:** Lack of defined metrics for R2.
5.  **Scalability Limits:** Both overall file system performance and specific component limits (e.g., Faiss `IndexFlatL2`).
6.  **Testing Complexity:** Mocking file system interactions requires specific tooling (`pyfakefs`).
7.  **Prompt Context Handling:** Undefined logic for processing retrieved context before LLM injection.

## 4. Synthesized Project Plan and Roadmap

A simulated group discussion synthesized the expert input and addressed the identified blindspots, leading to the creation of the `roadmap.md` document. Key decisions and plan elements include:

*   **Phasing Confirmed:** Adopted the PM's proposed milestones (1a-1d for R1, 2a-2d for R2).
*   **Addressing Blindspots:**
    *   *Indexer Trigger:* Start manual, recommend scheduled (cron) for deployment.
    *   *Concurrency:* Document assumption of non-concurrent access for initial phases.
    *   *Knowledge UX:* Defer UI, add validation (`--validate-only` idea) to indexer, emphasize contribution guidelines.
    *   *Evaluation:* Defer formal semantic evaluation metrics for R2.
    *   *Scalability:* Acknowledge limits, note potential Faiss index upgrades.
    *   *Testing:* Mandate use of `pyfakefs` or similar.
    *   *Context Handling:* Add placeholder task for post-retrieval processing logic.
*   **Technical Refinements:** Agreed on standard Python logging (JSON to stdout), use of `pathlib`, confirmed atomic writes for index.
*   **User Stories:** Defined initial user stories for Phase 1 milestones (US1-US4), breaking them down into specific, actionable tasks with technical notes and code hints where appropriate. High-level stories for Phase 2 (US5-US7) were also outlined.

## 5. The Roadmap (`roadmap.md`)

The primary output of this phase is the `roadmap.md` file, which details:

*   Project Phases and Milestones (R1a-d, R2a-d).
*   Phase 1 User Stories (US1-US4) with detailed descriptions, notes, and tasks.
    *   US1: Metadata Enforcement (YAML Parsing/Validation)
    *   US2: Index Generation (Indexer Script)
    *   US3: Metadata Retrieval (Retrieval Module API)
    *   US4: Integration & Dependencies
*   Phase 2 User Stories (US5-US7) outlined at a high level.
*   Code hints and diagrams embedded within tasks to aid implementation.
*   Key considerations regarding indexer triggering, concurrency, scalability, etc.

## 6. Conclusion

This third planning session successfully bridged the gap between detailed requirements and actionable project execution. By incorporating project management and product ownership perspectives, reviewing previous decisions critically, and identifying potential blindspots, the team produced a structured and realistic roadmap (`roadmap.md`). This roadmap, with its phased approach and detailed user stories for Phase 1, provides a clear path for development, enabling incremental delivery of value while acknowledging known limitations and outlining future enhancements. The focus now shifts to executing the tasks defined for Phase 1, Milestone 1a.
