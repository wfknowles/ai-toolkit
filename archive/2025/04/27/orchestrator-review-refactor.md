Request:

I think there's been some miscommunication or mismatch of expectations. Could you review `Orchetrator Refactor Analysis`, the prompt: `Orchetrator Refactor Prompt` that defined the scope and expectations of the refactor, the resulting refactored assets within `Orchetrator Refactor Asset Directory`, and the main MotM artifact directory: `Orchetrator Parent Directory`.

There was an initial run of the refactor that died and that correcttly created assets within `Orchetrator Refactor Asset Directory`.

There was a subsequent refactor that theoretically edited artifacts in place within `Orchetrator Parent Directory`

I was reviewing these steps where I thought I would maybe find the refactored usage of the `output_dir`, but it looks like its still being made in aux_files:
- `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/workflows/orchestrators/MotM/step-09-r2-requirements-refinement.prompt`
- `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/workflows/orchestrators/MotM/step-13-r3-roadmap-generation.prompt`

Are you able to review all artifacts and determine what has and has not been refactored to meet my requirements?
