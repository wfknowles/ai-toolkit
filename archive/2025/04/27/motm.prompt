# Prompt: MotM Workflow User Interface

## Goal
Configure and initiate a run of the MotM workflow with a user-provided concept.

## User Inputs (Please provide values below)

*   **USER_CONCEPT:** `[Replace this with the specific concept you want the MotM workflow to process]`
*   **TARGET_ORCHESTRATOR_PATH:** `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/workflows/orchestrators/MotM/Orchestrator.prompt`
*   **TARGET_WORKFLOW_DIR:** `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/workflows/orchestrators/MotM`

## Instructions for AI Execution Environment (e.g., Cursor)

You MUST perform the following actions sequentially:

1.  **Read Orchestrator:** Use the `read_file` tool to read the *entire* content of the file specified by `TARGET_ORCHESTRATOR_PATH`.
2.  **Modify Concept:**
    *   Find the line within the orchestrator content that defines the `INITIAL_CONCEPT` variable (likely looks like `INITIAL_CONCEPT = "..."`).
    *   Replace the existing concept string (within the quotes) with the exact string provided in `USER_CONCEPT` above. Ensure the new concept string is correctly quoted within the modified line. Handle potential escaping of special characters within the `USER_CONCEPT` if necessary for it to be a valid string assignment in the orchestrator's context.
3.  **Write Modified Orchestrator:** Use the `edit_file` tool to completely overwrite the file at `TARGET_ORCHESTRATOR_PATH` with the *modified* content containing the new `USER_CONCEPT`.
4.  **Reset State:**
    *   Use `run_terminal_cmd` to execute `rm -f [TARGET_WORKFLOW_DIR]/state.json`.
    *   Use `run_terminal_cmd` to execute `rm -rf [TARGET_WORKFLOW_DIR]/_aux_files`.
    *   Confirm these commands execute successfully before proceeding. Output a confirmation message like `[UI Prompt] State reset complete.`
5.  **Execute Main Orchestrator:**
    *   Instruct the execution environment to now run the main MotM orchestrator located at `TARGET_ORCHESTRATOR_PATH`.
    *   The environment should follow the detailed instructions within that `Orchestrator.prompt` file to execute the full workflow.
    *   Output a message like `[UI Prompt] Initiating MotM workflow execution... Monitor subsequent output from the main orchestrator.`

## Important Notes

*   This prompt modifies the main `Orchestrator.prompt` file directly.
*   It does *not* currently handle parameterizing the output directory (`_aux_files`) due to the complexity of needing to modify all Step Prompts as well. The output will still go to `_aux_files` within the `TARGET_WORKFLOW_DIR`.
*   Ensure the execution environment has the necessary permissions and tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`, ability to invoke other prompts).
