# Analysis: AI Tool Integration Framework MVP Roadmap (Round 3)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2024-07-23
**Source:** MotM Round 3 (Orchestrator)

## Abstract

This document details the process and outcomes of Meeting of the Minds Round 3 for the AI Tool Integration Framework. Building upon the MVP requirements defined in Round 2, this round focused on constructing a detailed project roadmap, breaking down the work into phases, milestones, user stories, and tasks. It also included a review for potential blindspots and anti-patterns. The synthesized results form the basis of the `roadmap.md` file.

## 1. Introduction

With MVP requirements for the framework components established (`requirements.md`), Round 3 aimed to create an actionable development plan. SMEs collaborated to define the implementation sequence, identify key tasks, assign component responsibilities (via task context), and refine the plan based on potential challenges.

*   **Prerequisites:** Round 2 Requirements (`requirements.md`), Round 1 Analysis & Interview Data.
*   **Methodology:** Individual SME pre-analysis (milestones/phases/steps, blindspot review), focused interviews refining the plan, facilitator synthesis, (simulated) group discussion finalizing the roadmap, user stories, and tasks.

## 2. Establishing Project Phases & Milestones for Framework Implementation

(Placeholder section discussing the rationale for the phased approach outlined in `roadmap.md`: Foundational Setup & Design -> Execution Environment -> Orchestrator (`read_file`) -> Orchestrator & UI (`edit_file`) -> Agent Integration & E2E Testing -> UAT & Release. Highlights dependencies driving the sequence.)

*   **Phase 1 (Design):** Critical for defining contracts and UX before parallel development.
*   **Phase 2 (Exec Env):** Building the core secure execution capability.
*   **Phase 3 (Orch - Read):** Delivering initial value with `read_file`.
*   **Phase 4 (Orch/UI - Edit):** Implementing the complex confirmation workflow.
*   **Phase 5 (Integration):** Connecting the agent and testing the full system.
*   **Phase 6 (Validation):** User testing and release.

## 3. Translating Requirements to User Stories & Tasks

(Placeholder section detailing how requirements (REQ-*) from `requirements.md` were mapped to User Stories (e.g., ORC-US-01, EXE-US-01, UI-US-01) and further broken down into specific, actionable Tasks (e.g., Task DEF-T-*, Task EXE-T-*, Task ORC-T-*) within the `roadmap.md`. Emphasizes linking tasks back to requirements.)

*   **User Story Focus:** Ensuring stories represent value from different perspectives (User, Agent, Operator, Orchestrator).
*   **Task Granularity:** Breaking work down to manageable units for planning and execution.

## 4. Addressing Blindspots & Anti-Patterns

(Placeholder section summarizing the review prompted in Phase 3 of the prompt.)

*   **State Management:** Confirmed DB/Cache approach is acceptable for MVP, addressing concerns about in-memory fragility (Principal Architect input).
*   **Concurrency:** Acknowledged potential race conditions in confirmation flow; needs careful implementation and atomic state updates (Architect input).
*   **Logging:** Need for cross-component correlation ID confirmed (Principal Architect input).
*   **Configuration Security:** Secure injection method (mounted volumes) preferred over less secure alternatives (SSE input).
*   **Phasing Feasibility:** Confirmed `read_file` first is viable (PM input).
*   **Security Reviews:** Explicitly integrated into plan (PM input).
*   **Accessibility:** Added as a consideration for UI design (UX input).
*   **Agent Status Updates:** Need for Orchestrator to potentially provide "WaitingForConfirmation" status identified (Agent Engineer input).

## 5. Refined Implementation Details

(Placeholder section capturing key technical/design refinements from Round 3 discussions.)

*   **Allow-list Config:** YAML format preferred, loaded via mounted volume (SSE).
*   **Diff Generation:** To occur in Execution Environment using `difflib` (SSE).
*   **Error Codes:** Standardized codes defined (PE, SSE).
*   **Confirmation UI:** Diff view default, clear explanation, specific elements defined (UX).
*   **Confirmation Timeout UX:** Defined user message (PO).

## 6. Conclusion

Round 3 successfully translated the framework requirements into a detailed project roadmap (`roadmap.md`), complete with phases, milestones, user stories, and tasks. The process included identifying potential blindspots and refining implementation details. This roadmap provides a clear execution plan for delivering the MVP AI Tool Integration Framework.
