# Principal Architect - Round 3 Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Based on:** Framework Requirements (`requirements.md`)

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps for MVP Framework (Focus on Architectural Review):**
*   **Phase: Design Review**
    *   Milestone: Review Detailed Component Designs
        *   Step: Review Orchestrator API Contracts & State Management Design.
        *   Step: Review Execution Environment Specification & Security posture (sandboxing, config).
        *   Step: Review UI <-> Orchestrator Interaction flow.
        *   Step: Ensure alignment with chosen architectural principles (e.g., decoupling).
*   **Phase: Implementation Review**
    *   Milestone: Review Key Implementation Choices
        *   Step: Spot-check Orchestrator confirmation logic implementation.
        *   Step: Spot-check Execution Environment sanitization & security controls.
*   **Phase: Integration Review**
    *   Milestone: Review End-to-End Flow
        *   Step: Analyze potential performance bottlenecks.
        *   Step: Verify error handling propagation across components.

*   **Blindspots/Anti-Patterns Check:**
    *   Revisit state management choice - is it overly complex/simple for MVP?
    *   Does communication protocol (queue) handle all necessary error/response types effectively?
    *   Is logging strategy across components consistent and sufficient for traceability?
