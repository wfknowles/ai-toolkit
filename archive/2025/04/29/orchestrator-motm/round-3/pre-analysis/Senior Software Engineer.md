# Senior Software Engineer - Round 3 Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Based on:** Framework Requirements (`requirements.md`)

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps for MVP Framework:**
*   **Phase: Execution Environment Setup**
    *   Milestone: Build Base Environment
        *   Step: Create Dockerfile for sandboxed Python env (GUIDE-EXE-001).
        *   Step: Include `file_io.py` and dependencies.
    *   Milestone: Implement Configuration Loading
        *   Step: Implement loading allow-lists from mounted file/env var (REQ-EXE-002, GUIDE-EXE-002).
    *   Milestone: Implement Communication Listener
        *   Step: Implement queue consumer/API endpoint (REQ-EXE-001).
        *   Step: Implement request parsing & validation.
*   **Phase: Execution Environment Logic**
    *   Milestone: Implement Tool Invocation & Sanitization
        *   Step: Implement logic to call correct `file_io.py` function (REQ-EXE-003).
        *   Step: Implement input sanitization layer (REQ-EXE-004).
    *   Milestone: Implement Result Handling
        *   Step: Implement capturing return values (REQ-EXE-005).
        *   Step: Implement sending results back to Orchestrator (REQ-EXE-006).
    *   Milestone: Implement Diff Generation (If applicable)
        *   Step: Add logic to read current file & call diff library (REQ-EXE-007).
*   **Phase: Testing**
    *   Milestone: Unit Test Execution Environment Logic
        *   Step: Test config loading, communication handling, sanitization, tool invocation.

*   **Blindspots Check:** Ensure `file_io.py` standardized error codes are sufficient; consider adding more if needed by Orchestrator/Model.
