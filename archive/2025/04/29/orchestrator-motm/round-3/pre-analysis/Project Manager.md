# Project Manager - Round 3 Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Based on:** Framework Requirements (`requirements.md`)

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps for MVP Framework:**
*   **Phase 1: Detailed Planning**
    *   Milestone: Refine WBS & Dependencies
        *   Step: Break down component implementation into detailed tasks.
        *   Step: Map dependencies between tasks (e.g., API spec needed before Orchestrator implementation).
    *   Milestone: Estimate Task Efforts
        *   Step: Get estimates from relevant engineers for tasks.
    *   Milestone: Finalize MVP Project Plan & Timeline
        *   Step: Sequence tasks based on dependencies and priorities.
        *   Step: Allocate resources to tasks.
        *   Step: Establish key milestones (e.g., End of Design, Exec Env Ready, Orchestrator Ready, UI Ready, Integration Complete, UAT Start).
*   **Phase 2-N: Execution Sprints**
    *   Milestone: Sprint Planning
    *   Milestone: Sprint Execution & Review
*   **Cross-Cutting:**
    *   Step: Track progress against plan.
    *   Step: Manage risks & issues.
    *   Step: Facilitate communication between component teams.

*   **Blindspots Check:** Is the phased approach (`read_file` first) feasible given dependencies? Are security review steps factored into the timeline?
