# SME Group Interview - Round 1 (Orchestrator Framework)

**Facilitator:** Welcome. We've reviewed the concept for the AI File I/O Integration Framework. Key discussion points from interviews include the orchestrator logic for edit confirmations, execution environment security, tool definition clarity, and the user experience of the confirmation step. Let's start with the Orchestrator and Execution Environment. Architect, Security Engineer, SSE - what are the biggest challenges and proposed solutions for securely invoking the `file_io` functions and managing the confirmation state?

**Architect/SecEng/SSE:** (Placeholder discussion covering tradeoffs of invocation methods - queue vs RPC vs subprocess, state management options, need for sandboxing, secure config delivery, standardized errors/logging from `file_io.py`.)

**Facilitator:** Product Owner, UX Engineer - considering the friction of the `edit_file` confirmation, how do we optimize the UI/interaction flow?

**PO/UX:** (Placeholder discussing diff view vs full content, clear communication, feedback during wait times, importance for MVP trust.)

**Facilitator:** Prompt Engineer, Agent Engineer - how do we ensure the AI model understands and interacts correctly with this framework, especially the `edit_file` workflow?

**PromptEng/AgentEng:** (Placeholder discussing tool definition details, handling results/errors transparently vs agent awareness, prompt strategies for explaining confirmation.)

**Facilitator:** CISO, Project Manager - considering the security requirements and component complexity, what are the implications for MVP scope and potential phasing?

**CISO/PM:** (Placeholder discussing MVP focus on core secure execution + confirmation flow, detailed logging, phasing `read_file` first, resource needs for security implementation/review.)

**Facilitator:** Okay, based on this, let's define the core architectural choices and priorities for an MVP framework...

**(Further placeholder discussion synthesizing viewpoints, deciding on invocation method, state handling approach, confirmation display, logging levels, etc.)**
