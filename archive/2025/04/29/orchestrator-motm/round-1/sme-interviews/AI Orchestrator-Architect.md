# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Interview (Orchestrator Framework)

**Facilitator:** Let's discuss the orchestrator's state management for the edit confirmation. What approach seems most robust (e.g., in-memory, DB, distributed cache)?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** (Placeholder discussing tradeoffs: in-memory is simple but not scalable/resilient; DB/cache adds complexity but handles restarts/multiple instances. Recommends starting simple if possible, planning for complexity.)

**Facilitator:** What are the pros and cons of different methods for invoking the Execution Environment (RPC vs. Queue vs. Subprocess)?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** (Placeholder comparing options based on security, performance, coupling, scalability, and error handling. Suggests queue for decoupling or sandboxed subprocess for simplicity if security allows.)
