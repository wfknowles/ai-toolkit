# CISO - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **Overall Risk Assessment:** Quantifying the risk introduced by allowing AI-driven file I/O, even with safeguards and confirmation. What are the worst-case scenarios?
*   **Policy & Compliance:** Ensuring the framework (especially allow-lists, confirmation requirements, logging) aligns with organizational security policies and any relevant data handling regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA if PII could be in files).
*   **Incident Response:** Planning for potential security incidents (e.g., malicious file read, unintended data modification despite confirmation, allow-list misconfiguration).
*   **User Trust & Acceptance:** Balancing security controls with usability to ensure user adoption and trust in the AI's capabilities.
