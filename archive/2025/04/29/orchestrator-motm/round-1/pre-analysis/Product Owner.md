# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **User Experience (Confirmation):** How critical is the confirmation step for user trust? Is it ever skippable for certain file types or directories (post-MVP)?
*   **Value Proposition:** Clearly defining the value of having the AI manage files vs. manual user action, balanced against the friction of confirmation.
*   **Success Metrics:** How do we measure the success of this framework? (e.g., % of file tasks completed successfully, user satisfaction with the confirmation flow, reduction in errors due to bad edits).
*   **Error Handling UX:** What should the user see when things go wrong (access denied, rejected edit, execution failure)?
