# AI UX Engineer - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **Confirmation UI Design:** Designing the optimal way to present the `edit_file` confirmation to the user. What information is essential? (File path, diff view vs. full content view, potential impact warning). How prominent should it be?
*   **Interaction Flow:** Mapping the user journey for both read and edit flows, including error states and the confirmation step.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:** How does the user know the status while waiting for confirmation or execution? How is success/failure clearly communicated?
*   **Minimizing Friction:** How can the confirmation step be made as unobtrusive as possible while still being secure and clear?
