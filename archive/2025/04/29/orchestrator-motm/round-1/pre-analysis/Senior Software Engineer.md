# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **Execution Environment:** What specific technologies are suitable for the execution environment? (e.g., Docker container, sandboxed process). How is code deployed/updated there?
*   **Configuration Management:** How will the allow-lists be implemented and securely injected into the Execution Environment? (e.g., env variables, config files, secrets manager).
*   **`file_io.py` Refinements:** Does the existing Python code need modification to better fit into this framework? (e.g., standardized error codes, better logging structure).
*   **Diff Generation:** For `edit_file` confirmation, should the Execution Environment or Orchestrator be responsible for generating a diff between current and proposed content?
