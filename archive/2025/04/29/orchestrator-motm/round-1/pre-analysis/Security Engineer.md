# Security Engineer - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **Execution Environment Security:** Hardening the execution environment (sandboxing, network isolation, minimal privileges). Preventing escape from the environment.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Securely managing and delivering the allow-list configuration to the execution environment. Preventing tampering.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Where should sanitization occur for `file_path` and `content`? (Orchestrator, Execution Environment, or both?). Focus on preventing injection attacks.
*   **Auditing & Logging:** Ensuring logs capture sufficient detail for security monitoring (who requested what, was it allowed, was it confirmed, success/failure). Secure log storage.
