# Project Manager - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **Scope Definition:** Clearly defining the boundaries of the MVP for this framework. What components *must* be built? (Orchestrator state logic, basic execution env, basic UI confirmation).
*   **Component Dependencies:** Mapping out dependencies between components (e.g., Orchestrator needs Tool Definitions, Execution Env needs Config Mgmt).
*   **Resource Allocation:** What skillsets are needed to build each component? (Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Security).
*   **Timeline & Phasing:** Can this framework be built incrementally? What are the major milestones?
