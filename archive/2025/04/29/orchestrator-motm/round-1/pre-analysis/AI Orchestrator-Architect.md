# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **Orchestrator Logic:** Designing the state machine or logic within the orchestrator to handle the `edit_file` confirmation flow (receiving proposal, triggering UI, waiting, handling response, calling execution env or informing model of rejection).
*   **API Contracts:** Defining clear interfaces between Orchestrator <-> AI Model, Orchestrator <-> Execution Env, Orchestrator <-> UI Layer.
*   **Execution Environment Invocation:** How will the orchestrator securely call the Python functions in the execution environment? (e.g., RPC, message queue, direct subprocess call - consider security implications).
*   **Scalability:** How will this framework scale if many users/agents are making concurrent file I/O requests, especially those requiring user confirmation?
