# AI Agent Engineer - Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Concept:** AI Tool Integration Framework for File I/O.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   **Tool Usage Logic:** How does the agent interpret the tool definition for `edit_file` to understand it needs confirmation? Does the agent need specific logic to handle the multi-step process?
*   **Parsing Tool Results:** How does the agent handle the different responses? (Success with content, success after edit, access denied, file not found, user rejected edit, execution failed).
*   **State Management:** Does the agent need to maintain state while waiting for user confirmation if the orchestrator handles it?
*   **Error Recovery:** If an edit fails after confirmation, how should the agent react? (Inform user, retry, suggest alternatives?).
