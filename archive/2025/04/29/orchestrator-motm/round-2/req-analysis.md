# Analysis: Defining MVP Requirements for AI Tool Integration Framework (Round 2)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2024-07-23
**Source:** MotM Round 2 (Orchestrator)

## Abstract

This document details the outcomes of Meeting of the Minds Round 2 for the AI Tool Integration Framework. Building on the conceptual analysis from Round 1, this round focused on defining specific MVP assets, strategies, methodologies, requirements, and acceptance criteria for each core component (Orchestrator, Execution Environment, Tool Definitions, UI Layer, Configuration Management). The results are captured in the `requirements.md` file for the framework.

## 1. Introduction

Round 1 established the high-level architecture and challenges for integrating `file_io.py` tools. Round 2 aimed to translate these concepts into actionable definitions and requirements for an MVP framework capable of supporting secure, confirmation-aware file operations.

*   **Prerequisites:** Round 1 Analysis (`analysis.md`), Round 1 Group Interview (`sme-group-interview.md`).
*   **Methodology:** Individual SME pre-analysis focusing on defining assets/strategies, focused interviews refining these definitions, facilitator synthesis, (simulated) group discussion finalizing component requirements.

## 2. Defining MVP Scope & Assets for Framework Components

(Placeholder section describing how key assets and strategies for each component were defined based on SME input.)

*   **Orchestrator:** Assets like API contracts, state schema. Strategy: Queue-based communication, DB/Cache state management.
*   **Execution Environment:** Assets like Dockerfile spec, config schema. Strategy: Secure config injection, diff generation within environment.
*   **Tool Definitions:** Asset: JSON Schema files. Strategy: Clear description of confirmation flow.
*   **UI Layer:** Assets like Wireframes, User Flow diagrams. Strategy: Diff view preferred.
*   **Config Management:** Assets like example config file, process definition. Strategy: Use secrets manager.

## 3. Requirement Elicitation & Refinement for Framework Components

(Placeholder section detailing the translation of Round 1 discussion points and Round 2 SME input into specific REQ-* and AC-* for each component listed in `requirements.md`.)

*   **Orchestrator Requirements (REQ-ORC-*):** Focused on handling conversation, parsing tool calls, managing confirmation state machine, invoking other components.
*   **Execution Environment Requirements (REQ-EXE-*):** Focused on secure execution, loading config, input sanitization, returning standardized results.
*   **Tool Definition Requirements (REQ-DEF-*):** Focused on accurate schema and description clarity for the AI model.
*   **UI Layer Requirements (REQ-UI-*):** Focused on displaying confirmation correctly and capturing user input.
*   **Config Management Requirements (REQ-CFG-*):** Focused on secure storage and delivery of allow-lists.

## 4. Addressing Key Challenges in MVP Definition

(Placeholder section discussing how specific challenges were addressed by the defined requirements.)

*   **`edit_file` Confirmation:** Addressed via specific Orchestrator state management (REQ-ORC-005), UI trigger (REQ-ORC-006), UI display (REQ-UI-002), and tool definition clarity (REQ-DEF-002).
*   **Security:** Addressed through Exec Env sandboxing guidelines (GUIDE-EXE-001), secure config requirements (REQ-CFG-*), input sanitization (REQ-EXE-004), and detailed logging guidelines (CISO input).
*   **Decoupling:** Addressed by preferring queue-based communication (GUIDE-ORC-002) and defining API contracts.

## 5. Guidelines and Future Considerations

(Placeholder summarizing key guidelines (GUIDE-*) and potential post-MVP enhancements.)

*   **MVP Guidelines:** Emphasize resilience, decoupling, strong sandboxing, clear UI, secure config.
*   **Post-MVP:** Conditional confirmation logic, more advanced diffing/patching for `edit_file`, enhanced monitoring, broader allow-list capabilities.

## 6. Conclusion

Round 2 successfully defined the core assets, strategies, requirements, and acceptance criteria for an MVP AI Tool Integration Framework. These specifications, detailed in `requirements.md`, provide a solid foundation for building the necessary components (Orchestrator, Execution Environment, UI Layer, etc.) to enable the safe use of the `read_file` and `edit_file` tools.
