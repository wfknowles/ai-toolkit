# Prompt Engineer - Round 2 Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** Reviewing `analysis.md` and `sme-group-interview.md` from Round 1.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows for MVP Framework:**
*   **Asset:** JSON Schema definitions for `read_file` and `edit_file` tools, explicitly noting `edit_file`'s confirmation requirement in the description.
*   **Strategy:** Defined error messages/codes to be sent back from Orchestrator for specific failures (rejected edit, execution fail) for model consumption.
*   **Methodology:** Process for testing model's understanding of tool definitions and response handling.
*   **Workflow:** Example conversation flow showing how the model should explain the confirmation need to the user.
