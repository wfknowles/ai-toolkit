**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** Reviewing `analysis.md` and `sme-group-interview.md` from Round 1.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows for MVP Framework:**
*   **Asset:** Pseudo-code/logic for agent parsing tool results (success, various errors, user rejection).
*   **Strategy:** Decision on agent awareness of confirmation step (e.g., Assuming orchestrator handles transparently for MVP).
*   **Methodology:** Test plan for agent's handling of different tool response scenarios.
*   **Workflow:** Agent error recovery flow (e.g., how agent explains a post-confirmation failure to the user).
