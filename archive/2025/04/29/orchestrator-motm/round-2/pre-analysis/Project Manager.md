# Project Manager - Round 2 Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** Reviewing `analysis.md` and `sme-group-interview.md` from Round 1.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows for MVP Framework:**
*   **Asset:** Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for framework components (Orchestrator logic, Exec Env setup, UI confirmation page, Tool Definitions).
*   **Asset:** High-level project plan/timeline for delivering the MVP framework (potentially phased: `read` support first).
*   **Strategy:** Risk register update for framework-specific risks (e.g., inter-component communication failures, security vulnerability in Exec Env).
*   **Methodology:** Definition of Done (DoD) for framework components and features.
