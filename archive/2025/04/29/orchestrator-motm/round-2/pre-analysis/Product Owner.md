# Product Owner - Round 2 Pre-Analysis (Orchestrator Framework)

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** Reviewing `analysis.md` and `sme-group-interview.md` from Round 1.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows for MVP Framework:**
*   **Asset:** User stories defining the confirmation workflow from the user's perspective.
*   **Asset:** Definition of MVP success metrics for the framework itself (e.g., framework uptime, tool execution latency, confirmation flow completion rate).
*   **Strategy:** Prioritization of framework features for MVP (e.g., core `read`/`edit` flow with confirmation is P0, diff generation P1).
*   **Methodology:** UAT criteria for the end-to-end file read and edit flows, including confirmation.
