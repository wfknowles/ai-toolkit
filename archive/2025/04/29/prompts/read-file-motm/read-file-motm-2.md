### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 1

Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs analysis and reserach and topics you might need to prepare for an interview where you'll work through their initial thoughts, and walk away with enough insight to plan the group phase of this round.

### Phase 4 - Individual Interviews

Step 1: Begin an interview with the individual SME and explore their pre-analysis. They need to be asked a series of questions utilizing your pre-planning:
- Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any assets, strategies, methodologies, or workflows?
- Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?
- If you were to take these definitions and bring it to fruition, what would your solution look like?
- Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?
- Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?
- Ask them if they believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?
