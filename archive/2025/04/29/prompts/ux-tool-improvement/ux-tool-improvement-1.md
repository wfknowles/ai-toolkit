**Concept**
Agentic Framework.
Core Principle: To create a robust, secure, and extensible system where an AI model (like Gemini) can safely interact with local resources (files, execution environments) and external services via well-defined tools, guided by user interaction and confirmation when necessary.
Current Components & Functionality (Review):
Orchestrator (orchestrator/main.py):
Central control flow.
Loads tool definitions (.json).
Integrates with Gemini API for initial call and sending back tool results.
Handles conversation history (basic).
Validates parameters against tool schemas (required fields).
Communicates with Execution Environment via HTTP API (/execute, /generate-diff).
Communicates with UI Layer via HTTP API (/display).
Manages pending confirmation state (in-memory).
Includes a Flask server to handle UI callbacks (/confirm/<request_id>).
Uses requests, Flask, google-generativeai.
Execution Environment (exec_env/main.py):
Isolated environment (intended for Docker).
Loads security configuration (allow_list.yaml).
Provides a Flask API (/execute, /generate-diff).
Uses file_io.py to perform actual file reads/edits based on allow lists.
Includes diff generation logic.
Uses Flask, PyYAML.
UI Layer (ui/main.py):
Basic Flask application.
Receives confirmation requests from Orchestrator (/display).
Renders an HTML template (templates/confirmation.html) to show diffs.
Submits user decisions (Approve/Reject) back to the Orchestrator's callback endpoint.
Uses Flask.
Tooling (tool_definitions, file_io.py, config):
JSON schemas define read_file and edit_file.
file_io.py implements the secure logic for these tools.
allow_list.yaml configures path permissions.
Conceptual Framework: wfkAi Agentic Framework
This framework builds upon the existing components, enhancing them and adding new capabilities for a sophisticated agentic system.
1. Core Orchestration Engine (Refined orchestrator)
Goal: Intelligent workflow management, robust state handling, seamless AI integration.
Enhancements:
Persistent State Management: Replace in-memory PENDING_CONFIRMATIONS with a persistent store (e.g., Redis cache, database like PostgreSQL/SQLite). This store should hold not just the request details but also the relevant conversation_history needed to resume the AI interaction after a callback. (Addresses Next Step 1)
Asynchronous Architecture: Fully embrace async operations, potentially using libraries like asyncio, aiohttp, FastAPI instead of Flask+threading for better performance and handling of concurrent requests/callbacks.
Sophisticated History Management: Develop a clear strategy for pruning, summarizing, or managing long conversation histories passed to the AI.
AI Model Abstraction: Create a pluggable interface to easily switch between different AI models/providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, local models).
Advanced Error Handling & Retries: Implement more specific error handling for API calls (AI, Exec Env, UI) and potentially add retry logic (e.g., using tenacity) for transient network issues. (Addresses Next Step 4)
Job Queue System (Optional): For long-running tools or high throughput, consider integrating a job queue (e.g., Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis) between the Orchestrator and Execution Environment.
2. Interaction Layer (Refined ui & User Experience)
Goal: Intuitive, informative, and efficient user interaction.
Enhancements:
Rich Web Interface: Evolve ui/main.py into a more complete web application (using Flask, Streamlit, or a separate frontend framework like React/Vue).
Real-time Updates: Use WebSockets to push confirmation requests to the UI instantly, rather than requiring the user to navigate manually. The UI can then display notifications and the confirmation dialog dynamically.
Improved Diff Display: Use a proper diff rendering library (e.g., diff2html-python backend + JS frontend) for better visualization in the UI.
Contextual Display: Show relevant conversation history or context alongside the confirmation request in the UI.
User Authentication & Authorization: Implement user logins if needed, potentially linking permissions to users.
Streaming Responses: Handle streaming text output from the AI or long-running tools directly to the user interface.
3. Secure & Scalable Execution Environment (Refined exec_env)
Goal: Run diverse tools securely, reliably, and efficiently.
Enhancements:
Formalized API: Define the /execute and other potential endpoints using an OpenAPI specification for clarity and easier integration.
Resource Management: Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time) within the Docker container, especially for code execution tools.
Dynamic Tool Loading (Optional): Explore ways for the execution environment to dynamically load and execute tool code based on requests, potentially reducing the need to rebuild the container for every new tool (requires careful security design).
Output Streaming: Modify the API and tool implementation (file_io.py etc.) to support streaming large file contents or command outputs back to the Orchestrator.
4. Expanded Tooling Ecosystem (New Tools & Refinements)
Goal: Empower the AI agent with a wide range of capabilities.
Refinements:
edit_file: Add options for specific line edits, appending, creating files.
read_file: Add options for reading specific line ranges or sections.
New Tool Ideas:
execute_code: Securely execute code snippets (Python, JS, etc.) in a sandboxed environment (e.g., within the Exec Env Docker container with strict isolation). High Security Risk.
run_terminal_command: Execute shell commands within the Exec Env container. High Security Risk. Needs careful allow-listing and input sanitization. Confirmation should likely be mandatory.
web_search: Perform web searches using APIs (Google Search, Bing, Brave Search) or scraping (using requests, BeautifulSoup).
http_request: Make arbitrary HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to external APIs. Needs allow-listing for target domains and careful handling of sensitive data/headers.
database_query: Connect to configured databases (SQL, NoSQL) and execute read queries (potentially write queries with heavy restrictions/confirmations).
git_operations: Perform git commands (status, diff, pull, potentially commit/push with confirmation) on configured repositories accessible to the Exec Env.
knowledge_base_search: Query a vector database or knowledge graph populated with relevant project documentation or user data.
5. Deployment & Operations (New Focus)
Goal: Reliable, scalable, and maintainable deployment.
Enhancements:
Containerization: Robust Dockerfiles for Orchestrator, Execution Environment, and UI.
Composition: Use Docker Compose for easy local development and testing setup.
Configuration Management: Centralized and secure management of API keys, database credentials, allow lists, etc. (e.g., using environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, or cloud provider secret managers).
Monitoring & Logging: Implement structured logging across all services. Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) and log aggregation platforms (ELK, Loki). Add health check endpoints. (Addresses Next Step 2)
6. Testing & Quality Assurance (New Focus)
Goal: Ensure correctness, reliability, and security.
Enhancements:
Unit Tests: Add pytest tests for validation logic, schema conversion, core tool functions (file_io.py), etc.
Integration Tests: Test API interactions between Orchestrator <-> Exec Env and Orchestrator <-> UI. Test the confirmation callback flow.
Tool Tests: Specific tests for each tool's behavior, including edge cases and security restrictions.
End-to-End Tests: Simulate complete user scenarios from prompt to final AI response, including tool execution and UI confirmation. (Addresses Next Step 3)
High-Level Roadmap:
Phase 1: Solidify Core Asynchronicity & State:
Implement persistent state management (e.g., Redis) for PENDING_CONFIRMATIONS, storing conversation history.
Refactor the /confirm callback to correctly use stored history for the final send_result_to_ai_model call.
Add basic unit tests for critical components (validation, state access).
Phase 2: Enhance Interaction & Basic Tooling:
Implement WebSocket communication between Orchestrator and UI for real-time confirmation requests.
Improve the UI (ui/main.py) to handle WebSocket messages and display diffs better.
Refine read_file/edit_file tools with more options.
Add a basic, highly confirmed tool like run_terminal_command (e.g., only allowing ls, pwd).
Phase 3: Production Readiness:
Finalize Dockerfiles and create Docker Compose setup.
Implement robust configuration and secret management.
Set up structured logging and basic monitoring/health checks.
Expand test coverage (integration, more unit tests).
Phase 4: Advanced Features & Tooling:
Implement more complex tools (web_search, execute_code with sandboxing, git_operations).
Explore advanced AI interaction patterns (multi-turn tools, AI self-correction).
Integrate knowledge base search.
Consider scaling architecture if needed.
