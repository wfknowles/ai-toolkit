# Pre-Analysis: Product Owner - Agentic Framework PoC

## Overall Impression
The framework addresses the core need of allowing an AI to perform file operations (`read`, `edit`) with a necessary confirmation step for safety. This aligns with the initial requirements for enabling basic agentic capabilities with user oversight.

## Review Focus
*   Alignment with original requirements and roadmap.
*   Functionality of implemented tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`).
*   User experience of the confirmation workflow (conceptual, as no UI exists).
*   Potential use cases and value proposition.

## Concerns / Refactoring / Flaws
1.  **Limited Toolset:** The current tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`) are foundational but limited. The value proposition increases significantly with more tools (e.g., shell commands, web search, API calls) as outlined in the roadmap/future considerations.
2.  **User Experience of Confirmation:** While functional, the current confirmation (request via WebSocket, response via REST POST) is disconnected. A real UI needs to present the confirmation request clearly, likely alongside the AI's reasoning/intent, and provide simple approve/reject buttons that seamlessly trigger the REST call. The confirmation message itself (`WSConfirmationRequest.message`) needs to be user-friendly (currently relies on the LLM generating good text).
3.  **Error Handling for User:** How are errors presented to the end-user? The current flow sends `WSToolResult` and `WSAiResponse` messages, but a UI needs to interpret these and display errors gracefully (e.g., "I couldn't read that file because access was denied" instead of raw JSON).
4.  **Lack of Context / Diff in Confirmation:** The current confirmation prompt (generated by the mock LLM) just states intent. For `edit_file`, the user *must* see the proposed change (a diff) before confirming. This is noted as a future improvement but is critical for usability and safety.
5.  **Discoverability of Tools:** How does the user know what the agent can do? The available tools need to be implicitly understood by the LLM (via schemas/prompting) and potentially made visible to the user.
6.  **Scope Definition:** The `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_PATHS_ROOT` is a technical detail. From a product perspective, we need to clearly define the *user's workspace* and what parts the agent should be allowed to access.

## Initial Thoughts / Recommendations
*   Prioritize implementing diff generation and display for the `edit_file` confirmation.
*   Focus on building a simple client UI to visualize the interaction flow and test the UX.
*   Define requirements for error presentation to the user.
*   Plan the phased introduction of more high-value tools based on user needs.
*   Ensure the LLM prompting strategy includes generating clear, user-friendly confirmation messages and reasoning.
