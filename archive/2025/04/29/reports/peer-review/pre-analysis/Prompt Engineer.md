# Pre-Analysis: Prompt Engineer - Agentic Framework PoC

## Overall Impression
The framework provides a basic structure for tool usage, but the interaction with the LLM is currently mocked. The real test will be integrating a live LLM and ensuring the prompts and tool schemas are robust enough for reliable function calling and result interpretation.

## Review Focus
*   LLM Interaction (`llm_client.py`)
*   Tool Definition Schema (`orchestrator/main.py` - `AVAILABLE_TOOLS`)
*   Meta-prompt strategy (mentioned in `llm_client.py` but basic)
*   Handling of tool results and errors back to the LLM.

## Concerns / Refactoring / Flaws
1.  **Mock LLM Limitations:** The current mock logic in `llm_client.py` is very basic and keyword-driven. It doesn't accurately represent how an LLM decides which tool to call or how it generates arguments. This makes it hard to assess the true robustness of the tool-calling flow.
2.  **Tool Schema:** The schemas in `AVAILABLE_TOOLS` are simple. For more complex tools, richer descriptions and parameter definitions will be crucial for reliable LLM usage. We should consider adding examples or more detailed descriptions.
3.  **Meta-Prompt:** The current meta-prompt seems placeholder. A robust meta-prompt is critical to guide the LLM's behavior, constrain its actions, define the tool usage protocol, and specify the expected format for responses (especially confirmation requests).
4.  **Error Handling -> LLM:** The `send_result_to_ai_model` mock simply summarizes success/failure. A real LLM needs detailed, structured error information (using the `ToolError` model properly) to understand *why* a tool failed and potentially retry or ask the user for clarification. The current mock might mask issues here.
5.  **Confirmation Prompt Generation:** The `edit_file` mock currently generates a static confirmation prompt (`"Okay, I can update... Please confirm..."`). Ideally, the LLM itself should generate this reasoning text based on the user's request and the action it intends to take. This needs careful prompting in the meta-prompt.
6.  **Argument Parsing Robustness:** The mock LLM currently generates arguments as a JSON string, which the orchestrator parses. Real LLMs might occasionally produce malformed JSON or incorrect arguments. The parsing and validation logic in `handle_prompt` needs to be very robust.

## Initial Thoughts / Recommendations
*   Prioritize replacing the mock LLM with a real one early in the next phase.
*   Develop a comprehensive v1 meta-prompt defining tool usage, response formats, error handling expectations, and confirmation behavior.
*   Refine tool schemas with better descriptions and potentially examples.
*   Implement robust JSON parsing and validation for tool arguments coming from the LLM.
*   Ensure `ToolError` details are passed back to the LLM correctly in `send_result_to_ai_model`.
