# Pre-Analysis: AI UX Engineer - Agentic Framework PoC

## Overall Impression
The backend architecture seems capable of supporting a conversational agent with tool capabilities. The key challenge from a UX perspective is designing the client-side interaction, especially around the confirmation workflow and presenting tool activity clearly.

## Review Focus
*   WebSocket communication protocol (`common/models.py` WS messages).
*   Confirmation workflow from a client perspective.
*   Asynchronous update handling (`ConnectionManager` usage).
*   Information presentation (AI responses, tool results, errors, confirmations).

## Concerns / Refactoring / Flaws
1.  **WebSocket Message Design:** The current `ServerWSMessage` union includes `WSAiResponse`, `WSToolResult`, `WSConfirmationRequest`, etc. This structure is functional but needs refinement for a smooth UI implementation.
    *   How does the UI distinguish between an AI response *before* a tool call, the *request* for confirmation, and the AI response *after* a tool result? Clearer message types or states might be needed.
    *   The `WSToolResult` includes the full `ToolResult` payload. Does the UI need all this information, or should it be summarized/simplified?
2.  **Confirmation Flow UX:** As noted by the PO, the current flow (WS request -> separate REST POST response) feels clunky for the UI. Ideally, the confirmation (Approve/Reject) should also happen over WebSocket for a more integrated experience. This would require changes to the Orchestrator's WS endpoint to handle incoming confirmation responses.
3.  **Asynchronous Updates:** The `ConnectionManager` allows pushing updates post-confirmation. The UI needs to be designed to handle these potentially out-of-order or delayed messages gracefully (e.g., updating the status of a previous request).
4.  **Streaming:** Text responses from the AI and potentially tool results (if large) should be streamed over WebSocket to improve perceived performance, rather than sending complete messages.
5.  **Lack of Tool Call Indication:** There's no explicit message indicating *when* the Orchestrator decides to call a tool *before* the result comes back (or confirmation is requested). A `WSToolCallPending` or similar message type (as discussed in Round 3 previously?) would help the UI show loading states or indicate activity.
6.  **Client State Management:** The client needs to manage its own state regarding pending confirmations, ongoing tool calls, etc., based on the WebSocket messages received.

## Initial Thoughts / Recommendations
*   **Refine WebSocket Protocol:** Collaborate on a revised set of WebSocket message types that map clearly to UI states (e.g., `AI_THINKING`, `TOOL_PENDING`, `CONFIRMATION_NEEDED`, `TOOL_RESULT`, `AI_RESPONSE`).
*   **Consider WS for Confirmation:** Evaluate moving the confirmation Approve/Reject flow entirely to WebSocket for better integration.
*   **Implement Streaming:** Prioritize streaming for LLM text responses.
*   **Add Pending Indicator:** Introduce a WebSocket message type to indicate when a tool call is initiated by the Orchestrator.
*   **Design UI Mockups:** Create mockups demonstrating how confirmations, tool results, and errors are presented to the user.
*   **Develop Client Prototype:** Build a basic client prototype to test the WebSocket communication and UX flows.
