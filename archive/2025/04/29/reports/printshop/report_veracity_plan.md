# Plan for Veracity Refinements in s3_upload_error_report.md (v1.2)

**Objective:** Enhance clarity and add minor nuances to the existing `s3_upload_error_report.md` file based on veracity checks. No fundamental inaccuracies were found, but minor improvements can increase trustworthiness.

**Steps:**

1.  **Refine Solution 2 Analysis (Pre-check `Content-Length`):**
    *   **File:** `s3_upload_error_report.md`
    *   **Location:** Section 4.2 ("Solution 2: Pre-check `Content-Length`..."), specifically within the "Detailed Mechanism" and "In-depth Cons" / "Unknowns/Risks" subsections.
    *   **Edit:**
        *   Explicitly state *why* `Down.open` might still yield an unsized stream even after a successful HEAD request: "*Critical Uncertainty:* ... `Down` aims to provide size if `Content-Length` is present, but if the server *also* sends `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, HTTP semantics prioritize chunked encoding, and `Content-Length` might be ignored by `Down` or intermediate proxies, meaning the stream might still lack a size. Verification during implementation or robust error handling on this path is essential."
        *   Add a note clarifying the size limit for the streaming path: "**Note:** The intended streaming path (`upload_stream`) in this solution is still subject to S3's single `PutObject` size limit (typically 5GB). Files larger than this would require the Temp File fallback regardless of `Content-Length` presence."

2.  **Add Metadata Complexity Note (Solutions 2, 7, 8):**
    *   **File:** `s3_upload_error_report.md`
    *   **Location:** Near the end of the "Implementation Complexity" or "In-depth Cons" subsections for Solutions 4.2, 4.7, and 4.8.
    *   **Edit:** Add a sentence similar to: "This approach also increases complexity in metadata handling (e.g., filename, content-type), requiring consistent logic to extract this information correctly from different sources (HTTP headers vs. Tempfile attributes) depending on the execution path."

3.  **Final Review:**
    *   Read through the entire edited document one last time to ensure consistency and clarity.

**Execution:** These edits are minor and can be applied directly to the `s3_upload_error_report.md` file.
