# Analysis: Defining MVP Requirements for Custom File I/O Tools

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2024-07-23
**Source:** MotM Round 2

## Abstract

Building upon the initial analysis from Round 1, this document details the process and outcomes of Meeting of the Minds Round 2. This round focused on translating the high-level concept of custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools into concrete definitions, requirements, acceptance criteria, and guidelines for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The synthesized results form the basis of the `requirements.md` file.

## 1. Introduction

Round 1 established the need and core considerations for the file I/O tools. Round 2 convened a refined group of SMEs (including a Principal Architect) to define the specifics required for implementation. The goal was to move from concept to actionable requirements for an initial, secure MVP.

*   **Prerequisites:** Round 1 Analysis (`analysis.md`), Round 1 Group Interview (`sme-group-interview.md`).
*   **Methodology:** Individual SME pre-analysis of prerequisites, focused interviews, facilitator synthesis, (simulated) group discussion to refine definitions and requirements.

## 2. Defining MVP Scope & Assets

(Placeholder section describing the process of identifying the essential assets, strategies, methodologies, and workflows needed *specifically* for the MVP, based on SME pre-analysis and interviews. Contrasts MVP scope with longer-term goals discussed in Round 1.)

*   **Key Assets Identified:** (List core assets like API Spec, Tool Code, Prompt Templates, UX Mockups, Test Plans, etc.)
*   **Key Strategies/Methodologies Adopted for MVP:** (List key decisions e.g., User Confirmation for Edits, Basic Allow-list, Structured Logging)

## 3. Requirement Elicitation & Refinement

(Placeholder section detailing how the high-level needs were translated into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART-like) requirements and corresponding acceptance criteria during the (simulated) interviews and group discussion.)

*   **`read_file` Requirements:** (Summary of REQ-RF-* and AC-RF-* derivation)
*   **`edit_file` Requirements:** (Summary of REQ-EF-* and AC-EF-* derivation, emphasizing the user confirmation flow)
*   **System-Level Requirements:** (Discussion of requirements for shared components like logging, API standards)

## 4. Addressing Key Challenges in MVP Definition

(Placeholder section discussing how specific challenges raised in Round 1 or 2 were addressed within the MVP requirements.)

*   **Security:** (How MVP requirements incorporate basic path validation, user confirmation for edits.)
*   **Usability:** (How MVP requirements specify user confirmation flow, basic logging for transparency.)
*   **Integration:** (How API specifications and logging schemas defined for MVP facilitate integration.)
*   **Rollback/Backup:** (Explicitly noting that complex rollback/backup is deferred post-MVP, focusing on safe edit confirmation instead.)

## 5. Guidelines and Future Considerations

(Placeholder section summarizing the guidelines (GUIDE-*) defined for the MVP and briefly touching upon areas identified for future iterations beyond the MVP, ensuring architectural decisions in the MVP don't preclude future enhancements.)

*   **MVP Guidelines:** (Recap of key implementation advice)
*   **Post-MVP Considerations:** (List of features/improvements deferred e.g., advanced rollback, finer-grained permissions, complex agent logic)

## 6. Conclusion

Round 2 successfully translated the conceptual framework from Round 1 into a defined set of requirements, acceptance criteria, and guidelines for an MVP of the `read_file` and `edit_file` tools. These are captured in `requirements.md` and provide a clear foundation for initiating development.
