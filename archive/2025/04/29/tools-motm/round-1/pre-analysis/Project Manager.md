# Project Manager - Pre-Analysis

**Concept:** Design custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools with tracking, metrics, security, backup, and rollback.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   Project scope and deliverables.
*   Resource allocation.
*   Timeline and milestones.
*   Risk management (schedule, budget, technical).
