# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis

**Concept:** Design custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools with tracking, metrics, security, backup, and rollback.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   User value proposition.
*   Key use cases and workflows.
*   Defining success metrics from a product perspective.
*   Prioritization of features (MVP vs. future enhancements).
