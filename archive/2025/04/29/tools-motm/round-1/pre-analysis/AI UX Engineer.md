# AI UX Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Concept:** Design custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools with tracking, metrics, security, backup, and rollback.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   How users (or the AI acting for a user) interact with these tools.
*   Feedback mechanisms for success/failure/progress.
*   User experience around rollbacks or viewing file history.
*   Transparency of tool actions.
