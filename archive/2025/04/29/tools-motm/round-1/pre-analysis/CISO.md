# CISO - Pre-Analysis

**Concept:** Design custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools with tracking, metrics, security, backup, and rollback.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   Overall risk posture associated with these tools.
*   Compliance considerations (e.g., data privacy regulations).
*   Incident response plan for potential misuse or breaches.
*   Alignment with organizational security policies.
