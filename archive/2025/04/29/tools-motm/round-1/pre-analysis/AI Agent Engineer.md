# AI Agent Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Concept:** Design custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools with tracking, metrics, security, backup, and rollback.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   How an AI agent would decide to use these tools.
*   Parsing tool output and handling errors autonomously.
*   Memory and context management related to file operations.
*   Tool usage constraints and safety guardrails for the agent.
