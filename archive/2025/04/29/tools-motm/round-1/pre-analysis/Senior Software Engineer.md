# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Concept:** Design custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools with tracking, metrics, security, backup, and rollback.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   Implementation details (language, libraries).
*   Error handling and robustness.
*   Backup and rollback mechanisms (versioning, snapshots).
*   Code-level security (input validation, permissions).
