# Security Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Concept:** Design custom `read_file` and `edit_file` tools with tracking, metrics, security, backup, and rollback.

**Initial Thoughts:**
*   Specific security vulnerabilities (path traversal, injection, data leakage).
*   Access control mechanisms (RBAC, permissions).
*   Secure logging and auditing for metrics and tracking.
*   Secure implementation of backup/rollback.
