# Principal Architect - Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Based on:** `requirements.md`, Previous Analyses

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps for MVP (Focus on Architectural Alignment):**
*   **Phase: Design Review**
    *   **Milestone:** Review API & Schema Design
        *   Step: Ensure API spec (Orchestrator) aligns with broader system standards.
        *   Step: Verify logging schema meets observability requirements and is extensible.
        *   Step: Assess security implications of API design (input validation points).
    *   **Milestone:** Review Implementation Plan (SSE)
        *   Step: Validate approach for path validation (security review).
        *   Step: Check error handling strategy for robustness.
        *   Step: Ensure implementation allows for future security/feature enhancements (e.g., rollback hooks).
*   **Phase: Integration Review**
    *   **Milestone:** Assess Agent Integration Plan (Orchestrator/Agent Eng)
        *   Step: Review integration points for potential bottlenecks or failure modes.
        *   Step: Ensure user confirmation flow is architecturally sound and secure.
*   **Blindspots/Anti-Patterns Check:**
    *   Review `requirements.md` for potential shortcuts (e.g., overly simple allow-list logic). Does MVP path validation strategy create future refactoring burden?
    *   Consider scalability of MVP logging approach.
    *   Is user confirmation mechanism designed to prevent race conditions?
