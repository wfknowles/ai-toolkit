# Analysis: MVP Roadmap for Custom File I/O Tools

**Version:** 1.0

## Abstract

Following the definition of MVP requirements in Round 2, Meeting of the Minds Round 3 focused on constructing a practical project roadmap. This involved translating requirements into phases, milestones, steps, user stories, and tasks. This document summarizes the planning process, key decisions, and potential challenges identified during the creation of the `roadmap.md` file.

## 1. Introduction

With clear MVP requirements (`requirements.md`) established, Round 3 aimed to create an actionable plan for development and delivery. The same group of SMEs from Round 2 collaborated to break down the work, assign responsibilities (implicitly through task context), identify dependencies, and refine the implementation strategy.

*   **Prerequisites:** Round 2 Requirements (`requirements.md`), Round 1 Group Interview (`sme-group-interview.md`).
*   **Methodology:** Individual SME pre-analysis focusing on planning, interviews exploring milestones/phases/tasks and potential issues (blindspots, anti-patterns), facilitator synthesis, (simulated) group discussion to finalize the roadmap and user stories.

## 2. Establishing Project Phases & Milestones

(Placeholder section discussing how the overall project was broken down into logical phases: Planning & Design, Core Development, Integration & Testing, UAT & Release. Explains the rationale behind the major milestones within each phase, based on SME input and dependencies.)

*   **Phase 1: Planning & Design:** Focus on finalizing specifications (API, UX) and definitions (Stories) before core coding begins.
*   **Phase 2: Core Development:** Building the standalone tool functionality.
*   **Phase 3: Integration & Testing:** Connecting the tools to the agent framework, building the UI, and performing end-to-end testing.
*   **Phase 4: UAT & Release:** Validating with users and deploying.

## 3. Translating Requirements to User Stories & Tasks

(Placeholder section detailing the process of converting the formal requirements (REQ-*) and acceptance criteria (AC-*) from `requirements.md` into actionable user stories (US-*) and specific development tasks (T-*). Highlights the collaborative nature of this definition.)

*   **Example:** Mapping REQ-RF-002 (Path Validation) to RF-US-01 and Task RF-T-01 (Implement path validation).
*   **Example:** Mapping REQ-EF-003/004 (User Confirmation) to EF-US-01, INT-US-02, UX-US-01 and associated tasks (EF-T-03, INT-T-04, UX-T-01, UX-T-02).

## 4. Identifying Dependencies and Potential Risks

(Placeholder section summarizing key dependencies between milestones/tasks identified during planning (e.g., API spec before implementation) and risks discussed (e.g., integration complexity, security review timelines). References Project Manager and Principal Architect input.)

*   **Key Dependencies:** API Spec, Core Implementation, Agent Framework readiness.
*   **Potential Risks:** Integration challenges, confirmation flow complexity, scope creep.

## 5. Addressing Blindspots & Anti-Patterns

(Placeholder section discussing the specific review for blindspots and anti-patterns prompted in Phase 3 of the prompt. Summarizes findings, particularly those from the Principal Architect regarding MVP path validation limitations and the need to consider concurrency.)

*   **Path Validation:** Acknowledged as a simplified MVP approach; requires future enhancement.
*   **Concurrency:** Not explicitly addressed in MVP requirements; needs care during implementation and planning for future versions.
*   **Logging Scalability:** MVP logging schema deemed acceptable for initial use but may need optimization later.

## 6. Conclusion

Round 3 successfully produced a detailed project roadmap (`roadmap.md`), breaking down the MVP development into manageable phases, milestones, user stories, and tasks. It incorporated planning input from all relevant SME roles and included checks for potential risks and architectural considerations. This roadmap provides a clear plan for executing the MVP development.
