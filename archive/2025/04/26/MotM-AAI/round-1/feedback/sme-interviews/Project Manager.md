## Interview: Project Manager (Round 1)

**Facilitator:** Based on the PO discussion, we're targeting an MVP with a fixed, potentially 2-round flow, focusing on clear user instructions and basic resumability, leaving RAG and configurability for later. Does this MVP scope seem well-defined and achievable?

**PM:** Yes, that sounds much more manageable and reduces risk compared to trying to boil the ocean initially. A fixed 2-round flow (Round 1: Analysis/Brainstorm -> LLM -> Save Output; Round 2: Process Output -> Generate Req/Roadmap Draft Prompt -> LLM -> Save Output -> Final Processing) is a concrete target. Focusing on the core loop and the user handoff clarity is the right priority.

**Facilitator:** Let's revisit risks. You mentioned LLM output variability and state management errors. Given the MVP scope, how do we best mitigate these?

**PM:** 
*   **LLM Output:** For the MVP, we have to rely heavily on clear prompting using markers (like the SSE's `<!-- START/END -->` suggestion). The script's parsing logic needs to be defensive â€“ maybe log a warning if markers aren't found, but try to proceed if possible, or at least clearly indicate which part failed. We accept that perfect parsing isn't guaranteed in the MVP.
*   **State Errors:** The resumability feature (CLI args + state file) is the primary mitigation. The script *must* validate expected input files based on the current/resumed step. If `round-2/step1_llm_output.md` is needed but missing, the script stops with a clear error: "Input file missing: [path]. Please ensure you saved the LLM output from the previous step correctly, then run: [resume_command]". This prevents cascading failures.

**Facilitator:** Okay, defensive parsing and explicit input validation. Does the conceptual delivery plan still hold for this refined MVP scope?

**PM:** Yes, the phases look right, just simplified:
1.  **Setup & Core:** Basic script, CLI for `--concept-file`, `--output-dir`, `--resume-*`.
2.  **Round 1 Impl:** Generate prompt 1 (using template), output instructions, define expected output file (`round-1_llm_output.md`).
3.  **Round 2 Impl:** Read `round-1_llm_output.md`, generate prompt 2 (asking for reqs/roadmap draft with markers), output instructions, define expected output file (`round-2_llm_output.md`).
4.  **Artifact Gen:** Read `round-2_llm_output.md`, parse based on markers, write basic `requirements.md`, `roadmap.md`.
5.  **Core Features:** Implement state file logic for resumability, add file validation checks, basic logging.
6.  **Testing/Docs:** Unit tests for non-LLM parts, basic README.
This seems like a logical progression.

**Facilitator:** Any concerns about dependencies or environment?

**PM:** Just the standard ones. Need a clear `requirements.txt` for the orchestrator's dependencies (likely just `PyYAML` initially if we defer RAG). Need clear instructions on the required Python version. Using `python -m` for execution is good practice to avoid path issues.

**Facilitator:** Finally, any thoughts on tracking progress for this kind of iterative, prompt-driven development?

**PM:** It's slightly different. Progress isn't just code commits. We need to track:
*   Implementation of script features (CLI, file handling, parsing).
*   Development and refinement of the fixed prompt templates for each step.
*   Testing the end-to-end flow *manually* with the LLM bridge to check usability and output quality.
Clear definition of done for each step in the delivery plan is key.

**Facilitator:** Good points on tracking. Thanks, this helps solidify the MVP plan.

## Project Manager - Simulated Interview

**Facilitator:** Welcome, Project Manager. We're discussing the implications of the strong user feedback against copy/paste. From a project management perspective, what are the biggest risks introduced by this feedback and the proposed solutions (AAI vs CAB)?

**Project Manager:** The biggest risk is **schedule uncertainty**, primarily driven by the AAI approach. The AAI path requires an initial investigation phase to validate the Assistant's capabilities. We don't know how long that validation will take, nor what the outcome will be. If AAI fails validation, we pivot to CAB, but that pivot consumes time allocated to the investigation. This makes estimating the timeline for delivering a solution difficult. The CAB path has less technical uncertainty but carries the risk identified by the PO: building something that doesn't achieve sufficient user adoption due to the remaining friction.

**Facilitator:** So, the AAI investigation is a critical dependency. What friction points or hard limits do you see in managing this project?

**Project Manager:** Friction points:
1.  **Decision Dependency:** Progress is blocked until the AAI validation is complete and the AAI vs CAB decision is made. We can't start implementing the core interaction logic until then.
2.  **Resource Allocation:** If AAI validation requires significant effort (e.g., building test harnesses for the Assistant), it might pull resources from other potential tasks.
Hard Limits:
1.  **Assistant Capabilities:** If the Assistant fundamentally lacks the required tools for AAI, that's a hard limit forcing us to CAB or other alternatives.
2.  **Timeline/Scope:** We need clarity on the overall desired delivery timeframe to understand how much time we *can* allocate to AAI validation before needing to commit to CAB.

**Facilitator:** If AAI were chosen after successful validation, how would that impact the project plan compared to choosing CAB?

**Project Manager:** AAI likely requires more complex implementation effort (polling logic, robust error handling around Assistant interaction) as outlined by the SSE. This translates to a potentially longer implementation phase *after* the validation phase. CAB implementation seems more straightforward, likely leading to a shorter, more predictable implementation phase, but it might require a subsequent phase for user testing/feedback specifically on the acceptability of the remaining friction.

**Facilitator:** How would you structure the project plan to accommodate the AAI validation phase?

**Project Manager:** I'd structure it with clear phases and decision gates:
1.  **Phase 1: AAI Validation (Timeboxed):**
    *   Define specific test cases for Assistant file I/O and instruction following.
    *   Execute tests.
    *   Document findings and reliability metrics.
    *   *Decision Gate:* Based on findings, is AAI viable? (Go/No-Go)
2.  **Phase 2a: AAI Implementation (If Go):**
    *   Implement orchestrator logic with Assistant interaction (instruction file generation, polling, error handling).
    *   Integrate with overall MotM process.
    *   Testing.
3.  **Phase 2b: CAB Implementation (If No-Go or Fallback):**
    *   Implement orchestrator logic with `pyperclip` interaction (copy, paste, validate, clear).
    *   Integrate with overall MotM process.
    *   Testing.
4.  **Phase 3: User Acceptance Testing / Refinement:** (Potentially more critical for CAB to validate friction level).
This explicitly builds in the investigation and decision point.

**Facilitator:** What are the key unknowns from a project management perspective?

**Project Manager:** The primary unknown is the **duration and outcome of the AAI Validation phase**. Secondary unknowns include the precise implementation effort required for AAI's polling/error handling and the potential need for a dedicated CAB user acceptance testing cycle.

**Facilitator:** Does the user feedback itself introduce any project blind spots?

**Project Manager:** It might create pressure to pursue the "perfect" AAI solution even if validation shows significant risks or required effort, potentially delaying the delivery of *any* improvement (like CAB). We need to balance the desire for zero friction with the practicalities of project delivery timelines and technical risk.

**Facilitator:** Who are the critical stakeholders or dependencies for keeping this project on track?

**Project Manager:**
1.  **Technical Team (SSE, Arch):** Dependency for executing AAI validation and providing realistic implementation estimates for both paths.
2.  **Product Owner:** Dependency for the final Go/No-Go decision on AAI vs CAB based on validation results and user value assessment.
3.  **Cursor Assistant Team (Implicit):** The capabilities and reliability of their tool are an external dependency for the AAI path.
4.  **User:** For feedback, especially if CAB requires acceptance testing.

**Facilitator:** Great overview. Thank you for clarifying the project management aspects.
