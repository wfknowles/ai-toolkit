## Product Owner - Initial Thoughts

**Core Goal:** Understand the value proposition, target user, and key success criteria for this automated MotM engine.

**Value Proposition:**

*   **For the User (Developer):** Provides a semi-automated, structured way to leverage LLMs for complex analysis, brainstorming, and artifact generation (requirements, roadmaps) based on an initial concept, *without* requiring direct API keys or complex external tooling setup. It systematizes a potentially ad-hoc process.
*   **Leverages Existing Assets:** Aims to utilize the existing RAG system and knowledge base.
*   **Consistency:** Offers a more consistent process for tackling different concepts compared to purely manual prompting.

**Target User:**

*   Likely the primary developer (William Knowles) initially.
*   Potentially other technical users comfortable with command-line execution, file management, and interacting with LLMs via copy/paste in an IDE like Cursor.
*   *Not* suitable for non-technical users in its proposed form due to the manual steps.

**Key Success Criteria (Minimum Viable Product - MVP):**

1.  **Core Workflow:** The system successfully orchestrates a defined (e.g., 2-3 round) MotM process for a simple concept.
2.  **Input:** Accepts a concept via text file or string.
3.  **State Handling:** Uses the file system to pass context between rounds reliably (given correct user actions).
4.  **Prompt Generation:** Generates clear, usable prompts for the user to copy to the LLM at each manual interaction step.
5.  **User Instructions:** Provides clear, unambiguous instructions to the user at each handoff point (what prompt to use, where to save output, what command to run next).
6.  **Output:** Produces the target artifacts (e.g., basic requirements, roadmap) in designated files at the end of the process.

**Desirable Features (Post-MVP):**

*   **Resumability:** Ability to restart the process from the last completed step.
*   **Configurability:** Allow customization of rounds, steps, personas, and prompt templates via config files.
*   **Internal RAG Integration:** Leverage the existing RAG system to enhance simulated SME knowledge.
*   **Error Reporting:** Clearer reporting to the user when something goes wrong (e.g., missing input file).
*   **Improved UX:** Ways to minimize the friction of the manual steps (e.g., script automatically opening generated prompt files?).

**Risks & Concerns (from a Product perspective):**

*   **User Experience Friction:** The manual copy/paste and file saving steps are the biggest risk to adoption and usability. If it's too clunky, it won't be used.
*   **Scalability of Value:** Does the semi-automated approach provide enough value over purely manual prompt chaining to justify the development and maintenance effort?
*   **Maintainability:** Will the complex prompts and file-based state management become hard to debug and update?
*   **LLM Dependency:** The quality of the final output is still heavily dependent on the underlying LLM the user interacts with manually.

**Questions:**

*   What is the *minimum* number of rounds needed to deliver valuable requirements/roadmap outputs?
*   How complex are the initial concepts expected to be?
*   How much variation is expected in the process for different concepts?
*   Can we define a very simple 2-round version first as a proof-of-concept?

**Focus:** Ensure the MVP delivers the core value proposition: a structured, semi-automated process generating the target artifacts. Pay close attention to the usability of the manual handoff points. Define clear acceptance criteria for the MVP.
