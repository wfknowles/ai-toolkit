## AI UX Engineer - Initial Thoughts

**Core Goal:** Evaluate and propose improvements for the user experience (UX) of the automated MotM process, given the significant constraints involving manual steps.

**Primary UX Challenge:** The "Manual Bridge" - The user acting as the conduit between the Python script and the LLM interface (copying prompts, saving outputs, running next commands). This is the main source of potential friction, confusion, and errors.

**Analysis of Proposed Workflow:**

*   **Clarity of Instructions:** The success of this workflow hinges *entirely* on the clarity and precision of the instructions provided by the script at each handoff point. They must be foolproof.
*   **Cognitive Load:** The user needs to track the current round/step, understand what the script just did, understand what the LLM needs to do, correctly save the output, and correctly invoke the next script command. This is a high cognitive load.
*   **Error Proneness:** Copy/paste errors, saving files to the wrong location or with the wrong name, running the wrong command â€“ many opportunities for user error exist.
*   **Flow Disruption:** Switching between the terminal (running the script), the LLM interface (pasting prompt, getting response), and potentially a file explorer (saving the response) disrupts workflow.

**Recommendations for Improving UX (within constraints):**

1.  **Hyper-Clear Instructions:** At each handoff:
    *   Use visual separators (like `---`) in the console output.
    *   State the *current round and step* clearly.
    *   Provide the prompt in a distinct block, easy to select and copy.
    *   Provide the *exact, absolute file path* where the LLM response must be saved.
    *   Provide the *exact command* to run next.
    *   Example Console Output:
        ```
        ===== MotM Engine: Round 2, Step 1 Complete =====
        
        Action Required: Submit prompt to LLM and save response.
        
        1. Copy the entire block below (between the lines) and paste it into your LLM:
        -------------------- PROMPT FOR LLM --------------------
        [...Generated Prompt Text...]
        --------------------------------------------------------
        
        2. Save the COMPLETE response from the LLM exactly to this file path:
           /Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/04/26/MotM/round-2/step1_llm_output.md
           (Ensure the file is saved with UTF-8 encoding)
           
        3. Once the file is saved, run the following command in your terminal:
           python -m motm_engine --output-dir /path/to/MotM --resume-round 2 --step 2
        ```
2.  **Simplify File Handling:**
    *   Generate predictable filenames automatically (e.g., `round-X_step-Y_prompt.md`, `round-X_step-Y_llm_output.md`).
    *   Provide the *absolute* path in instructions to minimize user error.
3.  **Minimize Manual Steps (If Possible):**
    *   Could the script *generate* the prompt into a `.md` file (`round-X_prompt.md`) and print instructions to `Open this file, copy content, paste to LLM`? This avoids potential console copy/paste errors.
    *   Could the script use `pyperclip` (already in requirements?) to *automatically copy* the generated prompt to the clipboard when it's ready?
4.  **Feedback and Progress Indication:** The script should clearly log what it's doing at each stage (`Reading input file...`, `Generating prompt...`, `Waiting for user action...`).
5.  **Resumability:** As noted by PM/PA, allowing the user to restart from a specific round/step (`--resume-round X --step Y`) is crucial for UX, preventing frustration if an error occurs mid-process.
6.  **Validation:** The script step *after* a manual LLM interaction should *validate* that the expected output file exists before trying to read it. If not, provide a helpful error message and the command to retry the previous step.

**Longer-Term / Ideal (Ignoring Constraints):**

*   A dedicated UI within Cursor (like a custom webview panel) that manages the state, displays prompts, allows submitting to the integrated LLM, and handles outputs automatically. This removes the manual bridge entirely.

**Focus:** Make the manual handoffs as explicit, simple, and error-resistant as possible. Use clear console output, absolute paths, and exact commands. Explore minor automation like auto-copying prompts. Ensure basic resumability and file validation.
