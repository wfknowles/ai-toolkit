## AI Agent Engineer - Initial Thoughts

**Core Task:** Considering how this automated MotM engine integrates with or acts like an AI agent itself, focusing on the interaction patterns, state management, and potential for internal reasoning (using RAG).

**Agent-like Properties:**

*   **Goal-Oriented:** The engine has a clear goal: take a concept, orchestrate an N-round process, produce requirements and a roadmap.
*   **Stateful:** It needs to maintain state across multiple steps and rounds (via the file system).
*   **Tool Use (Potentially):** It could potentially use the existing RAG system (`answer_query_with_rag`) as an internal tool to augment the information used in generating prompts.
*   **Orchestration:** It orchestrates a complex workflow involving multiple steps (script execution, user interaction, file I/O).

**Key Differences from Typical Agents:**

*   **Human-in-the-Loop for Core Reasoning:** The LLM reasoning step is externalized and requires manual user intervention. The engine orchestrates *around* this manual step rather than performing the core generation itself.
*   **Limited Perception/Action:** Its perception is limited to reading files specified in its logic. Its actions are limited to writing files, printing instructions, and potentially calling the internal RAG system.

**Implementation Considerations:**

1.  **Internal RAG Call:**
    *   **Feasibility:** Can the `motm_engine.py` script reliably import and call `answer_query_with_rag` from `agent_core.rag_agent`? Requires careful path management (using `python -m` for execution helps).
    *   **Initialization:** The `rag_agent` module currently initializes its components (Retriever, ContextProcessor, PromptManager) on module load. If `motm_engine` imports it, these will load once. Is this acceptable? Or should RAG components be initialized explicitly by the engine?
    *   **Benefit:** Allows prompts generated by the engine (for the user to pass to the LLM) to be enriched with context retrieved *by the engine itself* from the `brain/knowledge` base. This could make the simulated SME interactions more informed.
    *   **Cost:** Adds complexity, another potential failure point, and increases execution time for steps involving RAG.
2.  **Parsing LLM Output:** This is a classic agent challenge. How does the script reliably understand the output saved by the user from the LLM?
    *   **Structured Prompts:** As suggested by SSE/PM, prompting the LLM to use specific markers or formats (e.g., Markdown sections, JSON blocks within Markdown) is the most viable approach without direct API access (where function calling/structured output is easier).
    *   **Parsing Logic:** The script needs corresponding parsing logic (regex, simple string splitting based on markers) to extract the necessary information (e.g., requirements list, roadmap steps) from the saved LLM output file.
3.  **Flow Control:** The engine needs robust logic to determine the next step based on the current state (round/step number, existence of required input files).
4.  **Agent vs. Script:** While it has agent-like properties, it functions more like a sophisticated, stateful batch script with mandatory user interaction points. Calling it an "engine" or "orchestrator" seems appropriate.

**Alternative (More Agent-like, but likely violates constraints):**

*   If Cursor offered an API to interact with its *own* chat/LLM programmatically, the engine could potentially: 1) Generate the prompt, 2) Send it to the Cursor chat API, 3) Receive the response, 4) Parse it, 5) Save it, 6) Continue the loop automatically. This removes the manual bridge but seems outside the current constraints.

**Focus:** Treat the engine as a stateful orchestrator. Carefully design the interface for potentially calling the internal RAG system. Develop robust (but potentially simple) parsing logic for the LLM output files based on structured prompting conventions. Ensure the state transitions and user handoffs are explicit and reliable.
