## Project Manager - Initial Thoughts

**Core Focus:** Defining the scope, estimating effort, identifying risks, and outlining a potential delivery plan for the MotM engine MVP.

**Scope (MVP Definition):**

Based on PO analysis, the MVP scope is:
1.  A command-line Python script (`motm_engine.py`).
2.  Ability to process a user-provided concept (text/file).
3.  Orchestrates a *fixed*, predefined multi-round (e.g., 2 or 3 rounds sufficient to generate basic reqs/roadmap) MotM workflow.
4.  Uses file system (`MotM/round-X/`) for state.
5.  Generates prompts for manual LLM execution at required steps.
6.  Provides clear instructions for the user at handoff points.
7.  Parses saved LLM output files (assuming simple structure or markers).
8.  Generates final `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md` files in the output directory.

**Out of Scope for MVP:**

*   Configurable rounds/steps/personas.
*   Internal RAG integration for smarter personas.
*   Advanced error handling and automatic resumability.
*   UI/UX beyond clear console instructions.
*   File watching or other automation to reduce manual steps.

**Effort Estimation (High-Level for MVP):**
*(Assumes developer familiarity with Python, file I/O, basic prompting)*

*   Orchestrator Script Core (CLI, state logic, round flow): **Medium**
*   Round Definition (Fixed structure): **Low**
*   Prompt Generation Module (Template loading, context injection): **Medium**
*   File I/O & State Handling (Robust checks, naming): **Medium**
*   User Instruction Logic: **Low-Medium** (Requires careful crafting)
*   LLM Output Parsing (Basic): **Low-Medium** (Depends on assumed structure)
*   Final Artifact Generation (Reqs/Roadmap basic templates): **Low**
*   Unit Testing (Core components): **Medium**

**Overall MVP Effort:** Likely **Medium-High** complexity due to the intricate flow and state management via files, despite the fixed scope.

**Risks & Mitigation:**

1.  **Scope Creep:** Risk: Adding features like RAG integration or configurability to MVP. Mitigation: Stick firmly to the defined MVP scope. Log other features for post-MVP.
2.  **Underestimated UX Friction:** Risk: Even with clear instructions, the manual process proves too painful. Mitigation: Prototype the handoff instructions early. Keep the number of rounds/manual steps in the MVP minimal.
3.  **LLM Output Variability:** Risk: LLM doesn't follow structuring instructions in prompts, making output parsing unreliable. Mitigation: Design prompts requesting simple, marker-based structures (e.g., use `### Requirements Start` / `### Requirements End`). Keep parsing logic simple and robust to variations.
4.  **State Management Errors:** Risk: User errors in saving files or running commands break the flow. Mitigation: Implement checks for expected input files at each step. Provide clear error messages. Consider adding a `--step` argument to allow manual restarting from a specific point.
5.  **Development Environment:** Risk: Python path issues, dependency conflicts. Mitigation: Use `python -m` execution style. Keep `requirements.txt` up-to-date.

**Delivery Plan (Conceptual Phases for MVP):**

1.  **Setup & Core Structure:** CLI args, basic orchestrator loop, directory setup.
2.  **Round 1 Implementation:** Implement prompt generation for round 1, user handoff, define expected output file.
3.  **Round 2+ Implementation:** Implement logic to read Round 1 output, generate Round 2 prompt, handle subsequent handoffs.
4.  **Output Generation:** Implement parsing of final LLM output and generation of basic `requirements.md`/`roadmap.md`.
5.  **Error Handling & Testing:** Add file checks, error logging, unit tests.
6.  **Documentation:** Write basic README/usage instructions.

**Focus:** Deliver a functional MVP demonstrating the core loop. Manage scope tightly. Prioritize clear user instructions and basic error handling to make the manual steps manageable.
