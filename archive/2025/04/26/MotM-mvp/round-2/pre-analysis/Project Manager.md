# Project Manager - Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** Clear MVP scope (~6-10 week estimate), key risks mitigated by simplification/deferral. Agile approach confirmed. Need for Test Engineer identified.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows Needed:**

1.  **Asset: Project Backlog (Initial Draft):**
    *   Break down MVP features (from PO) into concrete Epics/User Stories/Tasks.
    *   *Examples:* \"Implement `insert_code_snippet` tool backend logic\", \"Develop VSCode chat webview UI\", \"Define API contract for /chat endpoint\", \"Setup Pytest framework & initial tool tests\", \"Investigate VSCode native Undo API\".
    *   *Strategy:* Use a standard backlog tool (Jira, GitHub Projects). Estimate stories roughly (e.g., story points) to refine timeline.

2.  **Asset: Sprint 0 Plan:**
    *   Outline key goals for the initial setup sprint.
    *   *Workflow:* Finalize API contract, set up Git repo, basic project structure (SSE), CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions running pytest), Docker setup, dependency installation, backlog grooming for Sprint 1.

3.  **Methodology: Agile Ceremony Schedule:**
    *   *Definition:* Define frequency and purpose of agile meetings.
    *   *Strategy:* E.g., Daily Standup (15 min), Sprint Planning (start of sprint), Sprint Review/Demo (end of sprint), Sprint Retrospective (end of sprint). Keep them focused.

4.  **Methodology: Definition of Done (DoD):**
    *   *Definition:* A checklist defining criteria for a backlog item to be considered complete.
    *   *Strategy:* Include items like: Code implemented, Unit tests pass, Code reviewed, Functionality meets ACs, Deployed to local Docker env, (Potentially) Basic documentation written.

5.  **Strategy: Risk Management Log (Updated):**
    *   *Asset:* Maintain a simple list of identified risks (technical, resource, schedule).
    *   *Strategy:* Revisit risks identified in Round 1 (e.g., `edit_file` reliability - now simplified, Gemini quirks). Add any new risks. Assign owners and mitigation strategies. Review periodically.

6.  **Strategy: Communication Plan:**
    *   *Definition:* How the team communicates day-to-day and how progress is reported.
    *   *Strategy:* Use chat (Slack/Teams) for quick questions, regular standups, dedicated meetings for design discussions, rely on backlog tool for task status, regular demos for stakeholder updates.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Need to onboard the Test Engineer quickly and integrate them into the workflow.
*   Ensuring the API contract gets finalized promptly in Sprint 0 to enable parallel work.
*   Accurately estimating effort for AI-related tasks (prompt engineering, agent tuning) remains a challenge.
*   Managing potential scope creep even within the refined MVP.
*   Coordination between backend (Python) and frontend (TypeScript) development.
