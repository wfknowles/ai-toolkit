# Principal Architect - Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** Confirmed API-first, modular architecture using FastAPI/Docker. Prioritized reliability and security. Agreed on VSCode extension for MVP UI, deferring terminal. Key decisions involve interface definitions, cross-cutting concerns.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows Needed:**

1.  **Asset: System Architecture Diagram (High-Level):**
    *   Visualizes the main components (VSCode Ext, Backend API, Orchestrator, Gemini Client, Tool Executor, Config) and their primary interactions/interfaces.
    *   *Strategy:* Reinforce modularity and API boundaries. Show data flow for core workflows.

2.  **Asset: API Contract Definition (e.g., OpenAPI Spec):**
    *   Formal definition of the API between the VSCode extension and the backend.
    *   *Strategy:* Use OpenAPI (FastAPI can auto-generate). Define endpoints (`/chat`), request/response models (Pydantic), authentication (if any - likely none for local MVP), and error responses. Crucial for parallel development.

3.  **Strategy: Interface Definitions (Code/Diagrams):**
    *   Define the internal interfaces between Orchestrator and Tool Executor, Orchestrator and Gemini Client.
    *   *Strategy:* Use Python protocols or ABCs to enforce contracts. Ensure tools return standardized result objects.

4.  **Methodology: Tech Debt Management:**
    *   *Strategy:* Acknowledge that MVP choices (e.g., no vector DB, simple agent) incur tech debt. Briefly document these decisions and potential future refactoring points.
    *   *Workflow:* Use `TODO` comments or backlog items to track known simplifications.

5.  **Strategy: Logging Standards:**
    *   *Definition:* Standardize on Python `logging`, structured JSON format. Define key information to log per request/event (request ID, timestamp, tool called, params (masked), duration, success/error).
    *   *Workflow:* Configure logging centrally. Ensure all modules use the standard logger.

6.  **Strategy: Security Standards (MVP):**
    *   *Definition:* Secure Gemini API Key handling (env var, `.env` file, ensure not checked into Git). Least privilege execution. Input sanitization (even if minimal for MVP tools). File path validation (prevent directory traversal).
    *   *Workflow:* Include security considerations in code reviews. Schedule security review with dedicated SME.

7.  **Strategy: Configuration Management Approach:**
    *   *Definition:* Use Pydantic Settings loading from env/.env. Define all key configurable parameters (API keys, model names, feature flags if any).

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Ensuring the API contract is robust enough for initial needs but flexible for future evolution.
*   Preventing tight coupling between components despite the initial monolithic structure.
*   Making sure reliability/security considerations are truly embedded in implementation, not just discussed.
*   Need to explicitly define how workspace paths are handled/validated to prevent security issues with file access.
