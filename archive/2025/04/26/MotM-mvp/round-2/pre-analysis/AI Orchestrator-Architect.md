# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** MVP confirmed as FastAPI backend, custom orchestration, ReAct agent using Gemini function calling, reliable `read_file`/`insert_code_snippet`, implicit file context RAG, VSCode extension UI. Modularity and reliability are key principles.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows Needed:**

1.  **Asset: Orchestration Flow Diagram:**
    *   Visual representation of the ReAct loop as implemented by the orchestrator.
    *   *Workflow:* User Request -> API Layer -> Orchestrator -> Context Prepper -> Gemini Client (w/ Prompt, Tools) -> [Gemini Response: Function Call | Final Answer] -> (If Function Call: Tool Executor -> Gemini Client w/ Tool Result -> Gemini Response) -> API Layer -> User.
    *   *Strategy:* Clearly show decision points (tool call vs. direct answer), error handling paths, and data flow (context, history, tool results).

2.  **Asset: Tool Interface Definition (Code - e.g., Python ABC/Protocol):**
    *   Defines the standard interface the orchestrator uses to interact with *any* tool executor.
    *   *Strategy:* Include methods like `execute(tool_name: str, params: dict) -> ToolResult` where `ToolResult` contains status, data, error info. Ensures consistency.

3.  **Strategy: Context Management Strategy (MVP):**
    *   *Definition:* For MVP, context is derived from the active VSCode editor file/selection. The extension sends `file_path` and `content_snippet` (or selection range) to the backend API.
    *   *Workflow:* Orchestrator receives this context -> Formats it appropriately (e.g., markdown block) -> Includes it in the prompt to Gemini.
    *   *Consideration:* Define limits on snippet size.

4.  **Strategy: Error Handling Strategy (Orchestrator Level):**
    *   *Definition:* Orchestrator will catch exceptions from Tool Executor and Gemini Client.
    *   *Workflow (Tool Error):* Catch specific tool exceptions -> Format error message -> Send back to Agent/LLM as function response for potential recovery (as defined by PE/AE).
    *   *Workflow (Gemini API Error):* Implement retry logic (e.g., exponential backoff) for transient errors. For fatal errors/content filters, format a user-friendly error message and return immediately.
    *   *Strategy:* Map tool exceptions to standardized error types if possible.

5.  **Methodology: Modular Design Implementation:**
    *   *Strategy:* Structure the backend code into distinct modules (e.g., `api`, `orchestration`, `tools`, `llm_client`, `config`) with clear responsibilities and dependencies managed via DI.
    *   *Workflow:* Define Pydantic models for data transfer between layers.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Managing state (conversation history, potentially intermediate results) within the orchestrator for multi-turn interactions needs a clear pattern (e.g., passing state explicitly, simple in-memory cache for short histories).
*   Ensuring the orchestrator correctly packages tool schemas for Gemini function calling and parses responses.
*   Defining the exact boundaries between the orchestrator, agent logic (within the LLM prompt), and tool execution logic.
