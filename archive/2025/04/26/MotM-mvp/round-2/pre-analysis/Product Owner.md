# Product Owner - Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** MVP goal is a reliable VSCode extension for code Q&A and simple code insertion, prioritizing trust and demonstrably better reliability than Cursor for these core tasks. `edit_file` simplified to insertion, `terminal` deferred.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows Needed:**

1.  **Asset: MVP Feature List & Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Formal list of MVP features (e.g., Chat Interface, File Context Display, `read_file` Use, Code Generation, `insert_code_snippet` Tool).
    *   *Strategy:* For each feature, define clear, testable acceptance criteria focusing on the core value. Examples:
        *   *Feature: `insert_code_snippet` Tool.*
            *   AC1: Given a valid file path, line number, and code snippet, the agent inserts the code correctly without altering other lines.
            *   AC2: Agent presents a preview showing insertion point context and code before action.
            *   AC3: Agent requires explicit user confirmation via button click.
            *   AC4: Agent provides clear success/failure feedback.
            *   AC5: Tool creates a backup file before modification.
            *   AC6: (If Undo feasible) User can undo the last insertion.

2.  **Asset: Key User Workflows (MVP):**
    *   Document the 1-2 primary workflows identified in Round 1 (Code Q&A, Code Gen & Insert).
    *   *Strategy:* Describe the steps from the user\'s perspective, including interactions with the VSCode extension UI and expected agent behavior/tool usage.
    *   *Workflow Example (Code Gen & Insert):*
        1.  User asks agent to generate a function in the chat.
        2.  Agent responds with generated code.
        3.  User clicks \"Insert Code\" button associated with the response.
        4.  Agent proposes insertion (shows preview, asks confirmation).
        5.  User confirms via button.
        6.  Code appears correctly in the file.
        7.  Agent confirms success in chat.

3.  **Methodology: User Feedback Collection Plan (Initial):**
    *   *Strategy:* Plan for collecting early feedback, even if internal initially.
    *   *Methodology:* Simple feedback command in chat (thumbs up/down), potentially link to issue tracker/form. Plan for informal usability testing/demos with target users (internal devs) during development.

4.  **Strategy: Reliability Metrics Definition:**
    *   *Definition:* Define how to track the reliability metrics discussed in Round 1.
    *   *Workflow:* Instrument backend/tools to log success/failure rates for key operations (`insert_code_snippet` attempts/successes). Potentially track user actions like \"Undo\".

5.  **Asset: Prioritized Post-MVP Feature List (Draft):**
    *   Maintain a rough, ordered list of features/improvements for after MVP based on Round 1 discussion (e.g., improve `edit_file`, enhance RAG, add safe `terminal` commands, standalone UI).
    *   *Strategy:* Keep focus on MVP, but have a view of the future direction.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Clearly defining \"reliable enough\" for the `insert_code_snippet` ACs is crucial.
*   Ensuring the initial RAG context (active file) provides enough value for the Q&A workflow.
*   Balancing the desire for a perfect insertion tool with the need to deliver an MVP.
*   Getting early feedback incorporated effectively into the agile process.
