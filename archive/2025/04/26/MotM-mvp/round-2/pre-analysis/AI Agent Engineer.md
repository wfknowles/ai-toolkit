# AI Agent Engineer - Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** Implement ReAct-style agent using Gemini Pro function calling. Focus on reliable integration with `read_file` and `insert_code_snippet` tools via orchestrator. Handle tool errors based on prompt guidance. Use implicitly passed file context.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows Needed:**

1.  **Asset: Tool Schema Definitions (Code/Config):**
    *   The concrete implementation (e.g., in Python dataclasses or dicts) of the tool schemas defined by PE, which will be passed to the Gemini API.
    *   *Strategy:* Ensure these exactly match the structure expected by the Google AI SDK and align with PE\'s definitions.

2.  **Methodology: Agent Logic Implementation:**
    *   *Strategy:* Implement the core agent loop within the orchestration service.
    *   *Workflow:*
        1. Receive user query + context + history.
        2. Prepare list of available tool schemas.
        3. Call Gemini API (`generate_content` with `tools` parameter).
        4. Parse response: If function call -> Extract name/params -> Request execution via Tool Executor. If text -> Return text.
        5. If function call executed -> Get ToolResult -> Format as function response -> Call Gemini API again with tool result.
        6. Return final text response.

3.  **Strategy: Tool Parameter Parsing & Validation:**
    *   *Definition:* Logic within the orchestrator or Gemini client module to safely parse the parameters returned by the LLM in a function call request.
    *   *Strategy:* Validate types. Potentially add basic semantic validation if possible before passing to the tool executor (e.g., check if `line_number` seems plausible, though tool must do final validation).

4.  **Workflow: Handling Tool Execution Results:**
    *   *Strategy:* The orchestrator needs to correctly receive the `ToolResult` (success/failure, data/error) from the Tool Executor.
    *   *Workflow:* Format this result into the specific structure expected by the Gemini API for a function response.

5.  **Methodology: Agent State Management (MVP):**
    *   *Strategy:* For MVP ReAct, state is primarily managed by passing conversation history back into the prompt. Keep history concise.
    *   *Workflow:* Orchestrator appends user messages and agent text responses (and potentially summaries of tool interactions) to a list representing the history, passing it on the next turn.

6.  **Methodology: Testing Agent Behavior:**
    *   *Strategy:* Focus integration tests (working with PM/Test Eng) on verifying the end-to-end agent flow for key workflows.
    *   *Methodology:* Mock tool execution initially to test LLM function calling/response. Then test with real tools. Verify correct handling of tool successes and documented errors.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Robustness of LLM parsing: Ensuring the LLM consistently outputs function calls with correctly formatted parameters according to the schema.
*   Handling multi-turn function calls if ever needed (though likely not for MVP ReAct).
*   Latency: The multiple calls to the Gemini API (initial request, potentially second call after function execution) might introduce noticeable latency.
*   Debugging agent behavior when it involves LLM unpredictability.
