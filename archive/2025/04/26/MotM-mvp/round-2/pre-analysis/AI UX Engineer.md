# AI UX Engineer - Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 1 Analysis:** MVP UI is VSCode extension (Webview). Focus on trust and transparency, especially for `insert_code_snippet`. Need clear previews, confirmation, feedback, context visualization, and ideally Undo.

**Initial Assets/Strategies/Methodologies/Workflows Needed:**

1.  **Asset: Wireframes/Mockups (VSCode Extension UI):**
    *   Visual designs for the chat webview.
    *   *Strategy:* Show layout of chat history, input area, context display section, agent action indicators. Create specific mockups for the `insert_code_snippet` preview (showing code, context lines, confirmation buttons).
    *   *Workflow:* Iterate on mockups based on team feedback before detailed implementation.

2.  **Asset: UI Component Library (Basic):**
    *   If using a framework (React/Vue) in the webview, define reusable components (e.g., ChatMessage, CodeBlock, ConfirmationDialog, StatusIndicator).
    *   *Strategy:* Ensure consistent styling aligned with VSCode aesthetics.

3.  **Methodology: UX Design for `insert_code_snippet`:**
    *   *Workflow:* 
        1. Define trigger (e.g., button on code response).
        2. Design the preview display (API call to get context if needed). Must clearly show *where* code goes.
        3. Design confirmation dialog/buttons (Insert, Cancel).
        4. Design feedback messages (Success, Failure + reason).
        5. Design Undo invocation (if feasible - e.g., button on success message, command palette).
    *   *Strategy:* Prioritize clarity and safety. Test preview comprehensibility with users/team.

4.  **Strategy: Context Visualization Design:**
    *   *Definition:* Design the UI element (e.g., sidebar section in webview) to display the file(s) currently in context.
    *   *Strategy:* Keep it simple for MVP (e.g., list of filenames). Consider visual cues for active/used context. Include a manual refresh/clear button.

5.  **Strategy: Error Message Design:**
    *   *Definition:* Define user-friendly text for common errors (tool failures, API errors).
    *   *Strategy:* Avoid technical jargon. Explain the problem simply. Suggest next steps if possible (e.g., \"Couldn\'t insert code: Invalid line number. Please check the line number and try again.\"). Work with PE/AE on wording.

6.  **Methodology: Usability Testing Plan (Informal MVP):**
    *   *Strategy:* Plan brief, task-based usability tests during development using internal team members initially.
    *   *Workflow:* Observe users attempting key workflows (Q&A, code insertion). Identify friction points, confusion with previews, or lack of trust.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Ensuring the webview UI is performant and doesn\'t feel sluggish within VSCode.
*   Technical limitations of the VSCode Webview API or Extension API impacting desired UX (e.g., native Undo integration).
*   Making the `insert_code_snippet` preview accurate and easy to understand quickly.
*   Designing effective onboarding for first-time users (post-MVP concern, but keep in mind).
