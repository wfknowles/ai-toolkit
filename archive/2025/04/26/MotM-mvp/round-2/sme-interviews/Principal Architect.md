# Interview (Round 2): Principal Architect

**Facilitator:** Welcome back. Your R2 pre-analysis focused on formalizing the architecture: diagrams, API contracts, interface definitions, and cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and tech debt.

**Facilitator:** For the System Architecture Diagram, what level of detail is appropriate for this stage? Should it include specific classes or just component interactions?

**Principal Architect:** For this stage, a **component-level diagram** is most appropriate. It should show the major logical blocks identified: VSCode Extension, Backend (FastAPI) Container, API Layer, Orchestration Service, Gemini Client Service, Tool Execution Service, Configuration. Arrows should indicate the primary direction of calls or data flow between them. We don\'t need class-level detail yet, but clearly labeling the interfaces/protocols between components (e.g., \"REST API\", \"Tool Execution Protocol\") is important.

**Facilitator:** The API Contract (OpenAPI Spec) is crucial for parallel development. Besides the main `/chat` endpoint, what other utility or configuration endpoints should we consider for the MVP API?

**Principal Architect:** For the MVP, keep it minimal but functional:
*   `/chat` or `/agent/invoke` (POST): The main interaction endpoint defined by SSE.
*   `/health` (GET): A simple health check endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`. Useful for verifying the backend is running.
*   Potentially `/config/schema` (GET): An endpoint that returns the schema for required configuration (like needing `GEMINI_API_KEY`), which the frontend could use to guide setup.
*   Maybe `/tools` (GET): Returns the list and schemas of available tools (for introspection or future UI use). Low priority for MVP.
Avoid adding complex configuration endpoints for MVP; rely on env vars/.env file initially.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned defining internal interfaces (Protocols/ABCs). How strictly should we enforce these in the initial implementation? Is loose coupling via clear function calls enough for the MVP?

**Principal Architect:** Using explicit Protocols or ABCs for the interfaces between the orchestrator and the tool executor/Gemini client is highly recommended, even for MVP. It adds minimal overhead but formally defines the contract, aids static analysis/type checking, and makes implementing mocks for testing significantly easier and more reliable. It\'s a small investment in structure that pays off quickly in maintainability and testability, reinforcing the modularity goal.

**Facilitator:** Regarding Tech Debt Management, what are the 1-2 most significant pieces of tech debt we\'re accepting with this MVP scope (e.g., no vector DB, simple agent)?

**Principal Architect:** The most significant are:
1.  **Simplified RAG:** Relying only on active file context severely limits the agent\'s knowledge. Integrating a proper vector DB and retrieval mechanism is a major future enhancement required for broader utility.
2.  **Simple Agent Logic:** The ReAct agent might struggle with complex multi-step tasks or maintaining long-term goals. More sophisticated agent architectures (planning, reflection) will likely be needed later.
Documenting these clearly sets expectations and guides future iteration.

**Facilitator:** For the Logging Standards, you mentioned JSON format and key events. Should we include a correlation ID to trace a single user request through different components (API, orchestrator, tool)?

**Principal Architect:** Absolutely. Implementing a **correlation ID** (or request ID) is essential for effective debugging in a distributed (even locally) system like this. Generate a unique ID when a request first hits the API layer, and pass it down through all subsequent calls (orchestrator, tools, Gemini client). Include this ID in *every* log message related to that request. This allows filtering logs to see the complete lifecycle of a single user interaction.

**Facilitator:** For Security Standards, SSE mentioned workspace validation for file paths. How should this workspace root be provided to the backend? Configuration? Per-request?

**Principal Architect:** This needs careful thought. Options:
1.  **Configuration:** Set the workspace root path as an environment variable or config setting when starting the backend container. Simplest, but assumes a single, fixed workspace per container instance.
2.  **Per-Request:** The VSCode extension could include the workspace root path in every API request. More flexible if the backend might serve multiple workspace contexts (less likely for MVP), but requires the extension to reliably provide it and the backend to trust/validate it.
For the MVP, configuring it once at **backend startup via environment variable** seems the most pragmatic and secure approach, assuming the backend serves one workspace at a time.

**Facilitator:** Any architectural blindspots remaining?

**Principal Architect:** We\'ve touched on observability with logging and metrics, but haven\'t defined the **metrics** themselves. What specific metrics will we track for tool reliability, latency, and cost (Gemini API usage)? Defining these upfront helps instrument the code correctly. Also, the mechanism for the VSCode extension to *discover* and connect to the local backend service needs to be defined (e.g., fixed port, discovery protocol?).

**Facilitator:** Other SMEs needed?

**Principal Architect:** Test Engineer and Security Engineer are confirmed needs. Collaboration with SSE on implementation details and AOA on orchestration flow is key.

**Facilitator:** Excellent points on formalizing the architecture. Thank you.
