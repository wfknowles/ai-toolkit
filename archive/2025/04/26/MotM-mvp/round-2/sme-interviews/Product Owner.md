# Interview (Round 2): Product Owner

**Facilitator:** Welcome back. Your R2 pre-analysis focused on concretizing the MVP via feature lists, acceptance criteria (ACs), workflows, feedback plans, and metrics. Let\'s add more detail.

**Facilitator:** You drafted ACs for `insert_code_snippet`. For AC1 (correct insertion), how do we define \"correctly\"? Does it just mean \"at the specified line without breaking syntax\" or more?

**Product Owner:** For MVP, \"correctly\" means:
1.  The exact `code_snippet` provided appears in the file.
2.  It appears immediately *before* the specified `line_number`.
3.  No other lines in the file are modified or deleted.
4.  Basic file integrity is maintained (it doesn\'t become corrupted).
It does *not* guarantee semantic correctness or perfect indentation relative to surrounding code for MVP â€“ the LLM should provide the snippet with appropriate indentation, but the tool just inserts it verbatim. That\'s a reliability baseline.

**Facilitator:** For the Key User Workflows (Q&A, Code Gen & Insert), are there specific edge cases or variations within these workflows we need to consider even for MVP?

**Product Owner:** Good point. Let\'s consider:
*   **Q&A:** What if the user asks about code *not* in the active file? For MVP, the agent should probably state it only has context for the active file(s) and prompt the user to open the relevant one.
*   **Code Gen & Insert:**
    *   What if the generated code is clearly wrong/bad? The user needs an easy way to discard the insertion proposal (covered by UX).
    *   What if the user wants to insert into an empty file? The `insert_code_snippet` tool needs to handle line number 1 gracefully.
    *   What if the user asks to insert something *huge*? We need limits (defined by Eng/Arch) communicated maybe implicitly (e.g., insertion fails or is slow).

**Facilitator:** The User Feedback Plan mentions a simple thumbs up/down. How will this feedback be used practically in the initial sprints?

**Product Owner:** Initially, it\'s a simple pulse check. Thumbs down signals potential problems needing investigation. PM/Team should review these (maybe weekly) to spot patterns:
*   Are many users downvoting responses related to a specific tool (e.g., `insert_code_snippet`)? -> Indicates reliability/UX issues there.
*   Are downvotes clustered around certain types of questions? -> Indicates potential gaps in context or prompting.
It won\'t drive immediate re-prioritization unless a critical failure pattern emerges, but it informs the focus for improvements and the backlog refinement for subsequent sprints.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned defining Reliability Metrics (e.g., `insert_code_snippet` success rate). How should the team use this data day-to-day or sprint-to-sprint?

**Product Owner:** 
*   **Sprint Goal:** A sprint goal might be \"Improve `insert_code_snippet` success rate for common cases from X% to Y%\" based on logged metrics.
*   **Debugging:** If the success rate suddenly drops after a change, it\'s a clear signal to investigate that change.
*   **Prioritization:** If metrics show `read_file` is consistently failing for certain paths (based on error logs maybe), fixing that might become higher priority.
It provides objective data to guide refinement efforts beyond just anecdotal bug reports.

**Facilitator:** Looking at the refined MVP plan and the proposed assets/strategies, do you see any remaining product blindspots or unaddressed user needs?

**Product Owner:** A remaining blindspot is the **initial setup and configuration UX**. How does the user install the backend and extension? How do they provide the Gemini API key securely? While maybe not part of the core *agent* experience, a clunky setup will deter users immediately. We need a simple, clear setup process defined (perhaps owned by SSE/UXE).
Also, while we simplified RAG, we need to ensure the \"active file context\" is genuinely useful enough for the Q&A workflow, or users will find it too limited quickly.

**Facilitator:** How should the team balance delivering the defined ACs versus exploring unexpected but potentially valuable agent behaviors discovered during development?

**Product Owner:** Stick to the defined ACs for the MVP features first and foremost. Reliability and delivering the core promise is paramount. If unexpected *positive* behaviors emerge, note them down (backlog item for future exploration). If unexpected *negative* or unreliable behaviors emerge, they likely need addressing as bugs if they interfere with the core workflows. We can explore novel capabilities *after* the reliable foundation is built.

**Facilitator:** Any other SMEs needed from a product perspective?

**Product Owner:** Test Engineer is key for validating ACs. AI UX Engineer remains crucial for making the features usable. Close collaboration with PM on backlog and priorities.

**Facilitator:** That adds important detail to the product definitions. Thank you.
