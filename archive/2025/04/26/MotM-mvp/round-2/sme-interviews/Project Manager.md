# Interview (Round 2): Project Manager

**Facilitator:** Welcome back. Your R2 pre-analysis laid out the operational plan: backlog, Sprint 0, agile ceremonies, DoD, risk log, communication. Let\'s refine the execution details.

**Facilitator:** For the Project Backlog, how granular should the initial stories/tasks be? Should we detail out every sub-task for, say, `insert_code_snippet` implementation from the start?

**Project Manager:** Initial backlog should have Epics (e.g., \"Implement Reliable Insertion Tool\") and User Stories derived from the PO\'s features/ACs (e.g., \"As a user, I want to insert code safely, so that my file is backed up before changes\"). Sprint 0 should break down Sprint 1 stories into more granular *technical tasks* (e.g., \"Implement backup logic in file_io.py\", \"Write unit tests for backup logic\"). We don\'t need exhaustive task breakdown for the entire MVP upfront, just enough for the next sprint or two. Estimation (story points) should happen at the story level.

**Facilitator:** The Sprint 0 Plan includes finalizing the API contract. Given this is crucial for parallel development, how do we ensure it gets done and agreed upon quickly?

**Project Manager:** Make it the primary goal for Sprint 0. Schedule dedicated working sessions involving PA, SSE, AOA, and the VSCode Extension developer(s). Start with the draft structure SSE proposed. Use FastAPI\'s auto-generation capabilities to create an initial OpenAPI spec. Iterate rapidly based on feedback, focusing on the core `/chat` endpoint and context/history structure first. Aim for a signed-off v1 API spec by the end of Sprint 0.

**Facilitator:** The Definition of Done (DoD) includes \"Code reviewed\". What does the code review process look like for this team/project?

**Project Manager:** For MVP, a lightweight but mandatory process:
1.  **Pull Requests:** All code changes via PRs in Git.
2.  **Reviewer(s):** At least one other relevant engineer reviews the PR (e.g., SSE reviews AE\'s agent logic changes affecting tool calls, PA reviews architectural changes, another SSE reviews backend code).
3.  **Checklist (Implicit/Explicit):** Reviewers check for adherence to standards (logging, config), correctness, basic security (path validation), test coverage, and clarity.
4.  **Approval:** PR requires at least one approval before merging.
Keep it efficient, focus on correctness and standards.

**Facilitator:** Your Risk Log needs updating. Besides the known technical risks (edit reliability, Gemini quirks), what other schedule or resource risks should we add now?

**Project Manager:** Additions to consider:
*   **Test Engineer Availability:** If we can\'t onboard a Test Engineer quickly, the burden falls on devs, potentially slowing testing and impacting quality/schedule.
*   **VSCode API Limitations:** UXE/SSE might discover unexpected limitations in VSCode APIs (e.g., for Undo, or Webview performance) requiring workarounds.
*   **Estimation Accuracy (AI Tasks):** Acknowledge the high uncertainty in estimating prompt engineering and agent behavior tuning tasks.
*   **API Key Management:** Process for securely distributing/managing the Gemini API key for local dev environments.

**Facilitator:** How will you handle the communication and coordination between the backend (Python) and frontend (TypeScript/VSCode Ext) development efforts?

**Project Manager:** 
1.  **API Contract:** The finalized OpenAPI spec is the primary contract.
2.  **Regular Syncs:** Brief, dedicated sync-up meetings (maybe 2-3 times per week initially) specifically for backend/frontend integration points, focusing on API usage, context passing, data formats.
3.  **Shared Understanding:** Ensure backend devs understand basic extension needs and vice-versa through demos and shared planning sessions.
4.  **Clear Task Ownership:** Backlog items should clearly indicate if they are backend, frontend, or require collaboration.

**Facilitator:** Does the Round 1 analysis or the proposed R2 assets/strategies reveal any project management blindspots?

**Project Manager:** The PO mentioned the **setup/installation process**. This needs to be explicitly added to the backlog as a feature/task, likely involving SSE (Dockerfile, README) and UXE (clear instructions). We also need to define the **local development environment setup** clearly for new team members (including the Test Engineer).

**Facilitator:** Any final thoughts on necessary assets, strategies, or workflows for the MVP?

**Project Manager:** A **basic CI/CD pipeline** setup in Sprint 0 is crucial. Even just running `pytest` automatically on PRs via GitHub Actions provides a huge safety net and enforces testing discipline from day one.

**Facilitator:** Okay, this gives us a clear operational plan. Thank you.
