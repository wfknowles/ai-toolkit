# Interview (Round 2): AI UX Engineer

**Facilitator:** Hi again. Your R2 pre-analysis detailed assets like mockups and component libraries, plus methodologies for designing the insertion UX, context display, error messages, and usability testing. Let\'s refine these.

**Facilitator:** For the Wireframes/Mockups, can you describe the key elements of the `insert_code_snippet` preview? What information must be immediately clear to the user?

**AI UX Engineer:** The preview needs utmost clarity:
1.  **Clear Title:** \"Confirm Code Insertion\" or similar.
2.  **Target File:** Display the filename prominently (e.g., `Inserting into: example.py`).
3.  **Insertion Point:** Show the target line number (e.g., `At line: 42`).
4.  **Context Snippet:** Display ~5 lines *before* and ~5 lines *after* the insertion line number from the actual file, clearly delineating the insertion point (e.g., with a horizontal line or marker).
5.  **Code Snippet:** Display the exact code to be inserted, formatted as code, clearly separated from the context lines.
6.  **Action Buttons:** Obvious \"Insert Code\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.
7.  **(Optional) Warning:** A small note like \"This will modify the file directly.\"
It needs to be instantly scannable so the user understands precisely what will happen where.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned a basic UI Component Library if using a framework. Is a framework like React/Vue recommended for the webview, or can we manage with vanilla JS for the MVP?

**AI UX Engineer:** While vanilla JS *can* work, using a lightweight framework like **React, Vue, or Svelte** within the webview is highly recommended, even for MVP. It significantly simplifies managing the UI state (chat history, context display, previews), handling user interactions, and building reusable components (like `ChatMessage`). This leads to more maintainable and scalable frontend code compared to complex manual DOM manipulation. The overhead is minimal for modern frameworks.

**Facilitator:** Let\'s talk about the Undo design for `insert_code_snippet`. If native VSCode Undo isn\'t feasible, how would a custom undo button/flow work from the user\'s perspective?

**AI UX Engineer:** If custom:
1.  **Trigger:** After a successful insertion message (\"Code inserted into `file.py`\"), include an \"Undo Insertion\" button directly on that message.
2.  **Action:** Clicking \"Undo\" triggers a call to the backend API (e.g., `/agent/undo_last_edit`).
3.  **Backend Logic:** Backend restores the file from the `.bak` file associated with that last action.
4.  **Feedback:** Chat UI updates to confirm \"Last insertion undone.\" The \"Undo\" button disappears or becomes disabled.
It should feel like a simple, immediate reversal of the last agent action.

**Facilitator:** For the Context Visualization design (e.g., sidebar list), how does the user *manage* this context? Can they add/remove files?

**AI UX Engineer:** For MVP, keep it simple and automatic:
*   **Display Only:** The list primarily *shows* the context the agent is using (likely just the active editor\'s file path).
*   **No Manual Add/Remove:** Avoid the complexity of letting users manually manage a context list for MVP. Context is implicitly determined by the active editor.
*   **Clear Button:** A single, clear button like \"Clear Chat & Context\" could reset the conversation and the agent\'s awareness of the active file, providing a simple escape hatch if things get confusing.
Manual context management is a post-MVP feature.

**Facilitator:** For the Error Message Design, you mentioned working with PE/AE. What\'s the UX role here beyond just wording?

**AI UX Engineer:** Beyond clear wording, UX ensures:
*   **Visibility:** Errors are displayed prominently enough in the chat without being overly alarming.
*   **Consistency:** Similar types of errors are presented similarly.
*   **Actionability (If Possible):** If the error suggests a user action (e.g., \"check file path\"), make it easy for the user to do so or provide the corrected information.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** The UI shouldn\'t break or become unusable if an unexpected error occurs.
It\'s about making the error understandable and minimizing user frustration.

**Facilitator:** Your usability testing plan is informal initially. When should we consider more formal usability testing with external users?

**AI UX Engineer:** After the core MVP workflows are stable and internally validated. Once we believe the tool is reliable enough *not* to constantly frustrate users, we should conduct formal task-based usability tests with a small group of representative developers outside the immediate team. This would likely be early in the post-MVP phase, before adding significant new features, to validate the core experience and identify major issues before broader release.

**Facilitator:** Re-evaluating blindspots: PO mentioned the setup/config UX. How should we approach designing this simple setup process?

**AI UX Engineer:** The setup needs to be dead simple:
1.  **Clear Instructions:** Provide concise instructions in the extension\'s README or welcome page on how to install/run the backend Docker container.
2.  **API Key Entry:** Offer a simple way to configure the Gemini API key (e.g., a VSCode setting input, or guiding the user to set an environment variable in the `.env` file used by Docker).
3.  **Status Indicator:** The extension UI needs a clear indicator showing if it\'s successfully connected to the backend service (e.g., \"Agent Ready\" vs. \"Backend Disconnected\").
4.  **Troubleshooting:** Basic troubleshooting steps in the README for common connection issues.
Minimize steps, use clear language.

**Facilitator:** Any other SMEs needed?

**AI UX Engineer:** Test Engineer for validating UI flows. Close collaboration with the **VSCode Extension Developer(s)** is essential. Coordination with **PE** on agent responses/error messages.

**Facilitator:** Great focus on the user experience details. Thank you.
