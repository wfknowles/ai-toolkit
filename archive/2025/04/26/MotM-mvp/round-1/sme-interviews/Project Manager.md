# Interview: Project Manager

**Facilitator:** Thanks for joining. Your pre-analysis focused on scope, phasing, resources, timeline, and risks. Let's get practical.

**Facilitator:** Based on the MVP scope converging around a backend service, reliable `read_file`, simplified `edit_file` (e.g., insertion), basic RAG/context, and a VSCode extension, what are the key dependencies we need to manage? For instance, can frontend work start before the backend API is stable?

**Project Manager:** Key dependencies:
1.  **Backend API Definition:** The VSCode extension work can start once the *interface* (API contract) for the backend is defined, even if the backend implementation isn't fully complete. Mocking the backend allows parallel development.
2.  **Core Tool Reliability:** The perceived success of the MVP hinges on `read_file` and the initial `edit_file` being reliable. These backend components are critical path items.
3.  **Gemini Integration:** The core backend needs successful integration with the Gemini API early on.
4.  **Basic RAG:** The VSCode extension needs *some* way to provide context, so the basic RAG/context mechanism in the backend needs to be available relatively early.
Essentially, define the API first -> parallel backend/frontend development -> prioritize reliable backend tool implementation.

**Facilitator:** What's a *rough*, order-of-magnitude timeline estimate for this MVP, assuming a small, focused team?

**Project Manager:** This is highly speculative without detailed requirements, but let's make some assumptions: a small team (e.g., 2-3 engineers) familiar with the tech stack, focusing solely on this MVP.
*   **Sprint 0 (1-2 weeks):** Finalize API design, setup project structure, CI/CD basics, detailed task breakdown.
*   **Sprints 1-2 (2-4 weeks):** Core backend service setup, Gemini client integration, reliable `read_file` implementation and testing, basic VSCode extension structure, start API integration (mocked).
*   **Sprints 3-4 (2-4 weeks):** Implement simplified but reliable `edit_file` (e.g., insertion) with testing, implement basic RAG/context mechanism, integrate VSCode extension with real backend API, initial UX refinement.
*   **Sprint 5 (1-2 weeks):** Integration testing, bug fixing, documentation, internal demo/release prep.
So, roughly **6 to 10 weeks** feels like a plausible range for this defined MVP. This heavily depends on the *actual* complexity encountered in making `edit_file` reliable, even the simplified version.

**Facilitator:** You identified `edit_file` reliability and `terminal` security as high risks. Given the Product Owner suggests simplifying `edit_file` and deferring `terminal` for MVP, how does that change the risk profile?

**Project Manager:** That significantly de-risks the MVP:
*   **`edit_file`:** Simplifying it (e.g., focusing only on reliable insertion) reduces implementation complexity and testing scope, lowering the risk of it blocking MVP delivery or being unstable.
*   **`terminal`:** Deferring it entirely removes a major security and implementation risk from the MVP scope.
The primary remaining technical risks become: ensuring the *simplified* `edit_file` is truly reliable, potential unforeseen issues with Gemini API integration, and ensuring the basic RAG provides genuinely useful context.

**Facilitator:** How should we manage the inherent uncertainty in AI development, like unexpected LLM behavior or the iterative nature of prompt engineering, within an agile framework?

**Project Manager:** Agile is well-suited for this:
1.  **Short Sprints (e.g., 1-2 weeks):** Allows for rapid feedback and course correction.
2.  **Spike Stories:** Explicitly allocate time for research/experimentation (e.g., "Investigate best prompt for reliable edit parameter generation", "Test performance of different chunking strategies for RAG").
3.  **Flexible Sprint Goals:** Focus on delivering working increments, but accept that the *exact* outcome of an AI-related story might differ slightly from initial estimates.
4.  **Frequent Demos:** Show working software often to get feedback from the PO and stakeholders on whether the AI behavior meets expectations.
5.  **Prioritize Reliability:** When uncertainty arises (e.g., LLM generates unreliable edits), prioritize work to improve reliability or simplify the feature over pushing ahead with unstable functionality.
6.  **Budget for Iteration:** Assume that features involving LLMs will likely require more iteration than traditional deterministic features.

**Facilitator:** Are there resource constraints or external dependencies beyond Gemini API access we need to consider?

**Project Manager:** Potential constraints:
*   **Team Skills:** Do we have sufficient expertise in Python/FastAPI *and* AI/LLM concepts *and* VSCode extension development (TypeScript/Node.js) within the core team?
*   **Testing Resources:** Do we have dedicated time/personnel for the thorough testing required, especially for the tools?
*   **Local Compute Resources:** Will local RAG indexing or running models/embeddings locally significantly impact development machine performance?
*   **Gemini API Quotas/Costs:** Ensure we understand and stay within any usage limits or budget constraints.

**Facilitator:** Any project management blindspots? Anything we're overlooking in terms of process?

**Project Manager:** A key process blindspot could be **managing the feedback loop**. We need a clear process for collecting user feedback (even internal initially), triaging it, and translating it into actionable backlog items. Especially for subjective things like "the agent isn't helpful enough," we need a way to diagnose the root cause (prompting? RAG? agent logic?) and assign it appropriately. Also, ensuring clear ownership and communication between backend, frontend (extension), and AI/prompt engineering efforts is crucial.

**Facilitator:** Other SMEs needed?

**Project Manager:** Primarily the **Test Engineer** role seems essential and consistently mentioned. Depending on the RAG complexity, **Information Retrieval** expertise might be needed later, but testing is key for the MVP.

**Facilitator:** Very helpful for planning. Thank you.
