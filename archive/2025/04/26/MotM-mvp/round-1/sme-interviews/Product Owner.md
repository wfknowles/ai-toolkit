# Interview: Product Owner

**Facilitator:** Welcome. Your analysis centered on the value proposition, MVP definition, prioritization, and user experience, especially regarding reliability compared to Cursor. Let's explore this.

**Facilitator:** You identified reliability of `read_file`, `edit_file`, and `terminal` as the key value proposition. How can we *measure* success here? What does a significant, user-noticeable improvement over Cursor look like in terms of reliability?

**Product Owner:** Success needs both qualitative and quantitative measures:
*   **Quantitative:**
    *   Reduce failure rate for `edit_file` operations on common tasks (e.g., inserting snippet, changing variable, applying diff) by X% compared to baseline (could be Cursor's perceived rate or an internal benchmark).
    *   Measure task completion time for standard workflows (e.g., find and replace across files) compared to manual methods or Cursor.
    *   Track the frequency of users needing to manually correct or abandon an agent-suggested edit.
*   **Qualitative:**
    *   User feedback surveys/interviews specifically asking about trust in the tool's file operations.
    *   Reduction in user reports of frustrating or unexpected behavior related to file edits or reads.
    *   Users *choosing* to use our tool for risky operations instead of falling back to manual methods.
A noticeable improvement means users *trust* the tool for core operations most of the time, rather than feeling like they have to constantly double-check or anticipate failure.

**Facilitator:** You outlined a potential MVP: basic chat, reliable `read_file`/`edit_file`, basic Gemini interaction, basic RAG, in a VSCode extension. Is this the absolute minimum? Could `edit_file` be simplified further (e.g., only inserts, no complex edits) or RAG deferred to speed up MVP delivery?

**Product Owner:** That list feels close to the minimum needed to provide distinct value over just using ChatGPT + VSCode. 
*   **`edit_file`:** We *could* simplify it initially (e.g., focus only on inserting code blocks reliably, deferring complex replacements or diff applications). This might be a pragmatic way to get *something* working reliably first. The key is that whatever `edit_file` functionality exists in the MVP *must* be trustworthy.
*   **RAG:** Basic workspace context (knowing what files are open, maybe simple keyword search over them) is probably essential for the agent to be useful beyond generic queries. A full vector RAG might be deferrable if we can provide useful context awareness more simply initially, but some context is needed.
*   **Terminal:** Definitely out of MVP scope unless we can define an *extremely* limited, high-value, and safe version (like running a formatter/linter).
We need to deliver a reliable core experience, even if slightly limited, rather than a broad but flaky one.

**Facilitator:** Post-MVP, you mentioned prioritizing Cursor's limitations. How do we balance fixing reliability/UX issues versus adding new features like advanced terminal interaction or a standalone GUI?

**Product Owner:** Priority #1 post-MVP must be solidifying the core promise: reliability. If `edit_file` is still shaky or RAG isn't providing good context, those need fixing before adding major new features. We should follow a hierarchy:
1.  **Fix critical bugs & reliability issues** in existing MVP features.
2.  **Address major UX friction points** identified in MVP usage.
3.  **Incrementally enhance existing features** based on feedback (e.g., make `edit_file` handle more cases).
4.  **Introduce new features** that address the next most significant user needs (likely better context/RAG, then perhaps *safe* terminal features, then consider GUI options).
We build trust through reliability first, then expand.

**Facilitator:** How strongly do you feel about the VSCode extension vs. a standalone GUI for the initial target users (developers)?

**Product Owner:** For the MVP and initial target users (developers comfortable in their IDE), a VSCode extension is the pragmatic choice. It integrates directly into their existing workflow, reducing friction. Building a standalone GUI adds significant overhead (UI framework, basic editor features) that detracts from focusing on the core AI/agent functionality for the MVP. We can revisit a standalone app once the core backend service is proven and we see demand for use outside of VSCode.

**Facilitator:** What are the 1-2 key workflows that absolutely *must* work reliably in the MVP for it to be considered successful from a product perspective?

**Product Owner:** 
1.  **Code Understanding & Simple Generation:** User asks a question about the code in an open file (`read_file` + RAG context). Agent provides an accurate answer based on the code. User asks for a simple code snippet (e.g., a function based on description); agent generates it correctly.
2.  **Basic Code Insertion:** User selects a location in a file and asks the agent to insert a generated or specified code block. Agent uses `edit_file` (simplified version) to insert the code accurately at the correct location without corrupting the file.
If we can nail these two workflows with high reliability, it demonstrates the core value proposition.

**Facilitator:** Any product-related blindspots? Are we making assumptions about user needs?

**Product Owner:** A potential blindspot is assuming *how* developers want to interact with an agent for coding. While Cursor provides one model, is it optimal? We need to build in feedback loops early (analytics, user interviews) to validate that the workflows we enable are genuinely useful and efficient, and be prepared to adapt the interaction model based on that feedback. We also assume reliability is the main differentiator; we need to confirm this holds true once users get their hands on it.

**Facilitator:** Other SMEs needed?

**Product Owner:** The **AI UX Engineer** is critical here to ensure the reliability translates into a usable and trustworthy experience. Agree with the need for a **Test Engineer** to objectively measure the reliability we're aiming for.

**Facilitator:** That clarifies the product priorities significantly. Thanks.
