# Interview: AI UX Engineer\n\n**Facilitator:** Hi there. Your analysis focused on the interaction model, tool UX, GUI, trust, and feedback – all critical for making this usable. Let\'s dive in.\n\n**Facilitator:** Given the MVP scope (VSCode extension, simplified `edit_file`, no `terminal`), how should the chat interface present the agent\'s actions, especially when it uses `read_file` or proposes an `edit_file` insertion?\n\n**AI UX Engineer:** Transparency is key, even for simple actions:\n*   **`read_file`:** Don\'t just silently use the file. Indicate it clearly: \"Okay, I\'ll read `filename.ext` to understand its contents.\" or show a small loading/thinking indicator associated with the file. When presenting content, use collapsible code blocks within the chat if it\'s long. Show which file the content came from.\n*   **`edit_file` (Insertion MVP):** This still needs careful handling. \n    1.  **Proposal:** The agent should explicitly state its intent: \"I suggest inserting the following code block into `filename.ext` at line Y:\".\n    2.  **Clear Visualization:** Display the code block clearly formatted. Crucially, show context – a few lines *before* and *after* the proposed insertion point from the actual file.\n    3.  **Explicit Actions:** Provide clear buttons/actions: \[Insert Code], \[Copy Code], \[Discard]. Avoid ambiguity.\n    4.  **Confirmation:** After the user clicks \[Insert Code] and the backend confirms success, show a clear success message: \"Code inserted into `filename.ext`.\"\n*   **General:** Use distinct visual styling (icons, background shading) for messages representing agent actions vs. agent responses vs. user messages.\n\n**Facilitator:** You highlighted `edit_file` as a critical UX challenge. Even for a simplified insertion-only MVP, what\'s the *minimum* required UX to ensure user trust and prevent errors? Is a diff view still needed?\n\n**AI UX Engineer:** For insertion-only, a full diff view is less critical than for complex changes, but context is vital. Minimum viable UX:\n1.  **Clear Intent:** Agent states *exactly* where it will insert.\n2.  **Context Preview:** Show 5-10 lines before and after the insertion point.\n3.  **Code Preview:** Show the exact code to be inserted, formatted correctly.\n4.  **Explicit Confirmation Button:** A clear \"Insert\" or \"Apply\" button.\n5.  **No Ambiguity:** The preview must leave no doubt about what will happen.\n6.  **Success/Failure Feedback:** Clear indication of outcome.\n7.  **Undo (Highly Recommended):** Even for MVP, a simple undo for the *last* edit provides a huge safety net and builds trust. If technically feasible via the VSCode API, prioritize it.\n\n**Facilitator:** Terminal interaction is deferred, but if we were to introduce a *very* limited version later (e.g., run a formatter), how would you approach its UX to maintain safety?\n\n**AI UX Engineer:** Extreme caution:\n1.  **Command Transparency:** Never just say \"running formatter.\" Show the *exact* command: \"Okay, I will run `prettier --write filename.ext`.\"\n2.  **Scope Indication:** Clearly state what files/directories the command will affect.\n3.  **Irreversible Action Warning:** If the command makes changes (like formatting), warn the user: \"This will modify the file(s) directly.\"\n4.  **Explicit Confirmation:** Use a distinct confirmation button (e.g., \"Run Command\").\n5.  **Output Display:** Clearly display stdout/stderr from the command.\n6.  **Restrict Options:** Don\'t allow customization of flags/arguments initially. Only allow predefined, known-safe command patterns.\n\n**Facilitator:** You recommended starting with a VSCode extension. What specific UI components within the VSCode API seem most suitable for building this chat and interaction experience?\n\n**AI UX Engineer:** We\'d primarily use:\n*   **Webview View Container:** Create a custom view in the sidebar (like Chat views in other extensions). The chat interface itself would be built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS framework like React/Vue) inside this webview.\n*   **Text Editor Decorations:** To visually highlight code sections the agent is referring to or planning to edit.\n*   **CodeLens:** Potentially add contextual actions directly within the editor (e.g., \"Ask agent about this function\").\n*   **Status Bar API:** Show agent status (idle, thinking, applying edit).\n*   **Command Palette:** Register commands for key actions (e.g., \"Clear Chat\", \"Retry Last Action\").\n*   **Notifications API:** For displaying errors or important status updates non-intrusively.\n*   **Diff View API:** Essential if/when we implement more complex `edit_file` capabilities.\n\n**Facilitator:** How can the UI effectively visualize the agent\'s context (e.g., which files it\'s aware of)?\n\n**AI UX Engineer:** \n*   **Context List:** Have a dedicated section in the webview sidebar showing files currently considered \"in context\". This could be manually added by the user or automatically inferred (e.g., currently open file).\n*   **Visual Indicators:** Use icons or subtle highlighting next to filenames (in the context list or even editor tabs) that the agent is actively using.\n*   **Explicit Mentions:** Encourage the agent (via prompts) to explicitly mention which file context it\'s using in its responses (e.g., \"Based on my reading of `utils.py`...\").\n*   **Context Refresh:** Provide a clear way for the user to clear or refresh the agent\'s context.\n\n**Facilitator:** Any UX blindspots in the current plan? What pitfalls should we avoid?\n\n**AI UX Engineer:** Pitfalls:\n*   **Over-reliance on Chat:** Don\'t force everything into a linear chat. Use UI elements (buttons, previews) for actions and confirmations.\n*   **Lack of Feedback:** The user should never wonder what the agent is doing. Provide constant, subtle feedback (status indicators, thinking messages).\n*   **Ambiguous Previews:** Ensure previews for edits are crystal clear.\n*   **Difficult Error Recovery:** If something goes wrong (failed edit, bad response), make it easy for the user to understand the error and retry or correct course.\n*   **Ignoring VSCode Conventions:** Ensure the extension feels integrated and follows standard VSCode UI patterns where possible.\nBlindspot: We haven\'t discussed **onboarding** – how users first learn how to use the tool and understand its capabilities/limitations.\n\n**Facilitator:** Other SMEs needed?\n\n**AI UX Engineer:** Collaboration with the **Prompt Engineer** is vital to ensure the agent\'s responses align with the desired UX (e.g., providing clear explanations of intent). Close collaboration with the **Senior Software Engineer** implementing the VSCode extension is also key. And yes, a **Test Engineer** to validate the UX flows and reliability.\n\n**Facilitator:** Fantastic points on usability and trust. Thank you.
