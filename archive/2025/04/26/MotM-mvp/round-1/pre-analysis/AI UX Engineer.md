# AI UX Engineer - Initial Analysis

**Core Concept:** Design the user experience for a local, Gemini-powered agentic application, focusing on usability, trust, and seamless integration into developer workflows, particularly addressing the interaction challenges of file I/O and terminal access.

**Initial Thoughts:**

1.  **Interaction Model:**
    *   Chat Interface: How to best present the agent's reasoning, planned actions, and results within a chat format? Consider structured messages, visual cues for tool use.
    *   Context Management: How does the user manage/understand the context (files, history) being provided to the agent? Visual indicators of active context.
    *   Improving on Cursor: Analyze Cursor's chat UX. Where does it succeed/fail? How can we improve clarity, reduce ambiguity, and enhance user control?

2.  **Tool Interaction UX (`read_file`, `edit_file`, terminal):**
    *   `read_file`: How is the content displayed? How does the user navigate large files presented by the agent?
    *   `edit_file`: **Critical UX challenge.** How do we:
        *   Clearly present proposed changes (diff view is essential)?
        *   Allow user confirmation/rejection/modification before applying?
        *   Provide undo functionality?
        *   Communicate success/failure clearly?
    *   `terminal`: **Highest Risk UX.** How do we:
        *   Ensure the user understands exactly what command will be run?
        *   Provide clear confirmation steps?
        *   Display output effectively?
        *   Manage security concerns from a UX perspective (warnings, confirmations)?

3.  **GUI Choice (VSCode Ext vs. Standalone):**
    *   VSCode Extension: Leverages existing UI paradigms, familiarity. Good for MVP. Potential constraints from VSCode API.
    *   Standalone App: More design freedom, potential for novel UX patterns tailored to AI interaction. More initial effort. Requires building basic editor/file management features if needed.
    *   Recommendation: Start with VSCode extension for MVP, design backend API flexibly to allow future standalone GUI.

4.  **Trust and Transparency:**
    *   How do we build user trust? Primarily through reliability and transparency.
    *   Show the agent's work: Displaying the plan, the tools being used, intermediate results.
    *   Clear error messages and recovery paths.

5.  **Feedback Mechanisms:**
    *   How can users provide feedback on the agent's performance (e.g., thumbs up/down on responses, reporting errors)?
    *   How is this feedback used to improve the system?

**Key Questions:**
*   What is the most intuitive and safe way to present potentially destructive actions (`edit_file`, terminal) for user confirmation?
*   How can the UI effectively visualize the agent's context and reasoning process?
*   What specific UX elements from Cursor (or other AI tools) should we emulate or explicitly avoid?
*   What are the essential UI components needed for the MVP within a VSCode extension?
