# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Analysis

**Core Concept:** Implement the core agentic logic for a local application using Gemini, focusing on effective tool usage, planning, and interaction with the backend infrastructure (orchestrator, tools, RAG).

**Initial Thoughts:**

1.  **Agent Design Pattern:**
    *   Start Simple: A ReAct (Reason+Act) agent seems appropriate for the MVP. The agent receives a prompt, reasons about the next step (which might be using a tool or responding), takes the action, and gets the result to continue the loop.
    *   Planning: For more complex tasks later, consider incorporating planning capabilities (e.g., generating a multi-step plan before execution).
    *   Memory: How will the agent maintain short-term memory (conversation history) and potentially integrate with longer-term memory or knowledge retrieved via RAG?

2.  **Tool Integration:**
    *   Gemini Function Calling: Leverage Gemini's built-in function calling capabilities. Requires well-defined tool schemas (name, description, parameters).
    *   Prompting for Tool Use: Develop robust prompt strategies (as highlighted by Prompt Engineer) to guide the LLM on *when* and *how* to use the custom tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`, terminal) correctly and reliably.
    *   Handling Tool Outputs: The agent needs to correctly parse and utilize the outputs from tool executions (file content, edit success/failure, terminal output/errors).
    *   Error Handling: How does the agent react if a tool call fails? Can it retry? Can it reformulate its request? Can it ask the user for help?

3.  **Interaction with Orchestrator:**
    *   The agent logic will likely reside within the service layer managed by the orchestrator (as discussed by AI Architect).
    *   The orchestrator passes user requests to the agent, invokes tools based on the agent's decisions, and manages the overall flow.

4.  **RAG Integration:**
    *   How does the agent decide *when* to query the RAG system vs. relying on its internal knowledge or conversation history?
    *   How does the agent formulate effective queries for the RAG system based on the user's request?
    *   How is retrieved context incorporated into the agent's prompt for subsequent Gemini calls?

5.  **Reliability & Evaluation:**
    *   Focus on making tool usage reliable. Test edge cases for `read_file`, `edit_file`, and `terminal` tool calls.
    *   Develop evaluation metrics specifically for agent task success (e.g., was the file edited correctly? Was the requested information retrieved?).

**Key Questions:**
*   What specific ReAct prompt structure will be most effective for guiding Gemini with the custom tools?
*   How can we best design the tool schemas for Gemini's function calling to maximize reliability?
*   What strategies will the agent use to recover from failed tool executions?
*   How will the agent manage the context window effectively when incorporating conversation history, RAG results, and tool outputs?
*   What are the simplest agentic workflows (e.g., file Q&A, simple code refactoring) to target for the MVP?
