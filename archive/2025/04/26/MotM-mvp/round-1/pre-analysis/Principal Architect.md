# Principal Architect - Initial Analysis

**Core Concept:** Establish a foundational architecture for a local, Gemini-based agentic application with long-term sustainability, reliability, and security in mind, even when starting small.

**Initial Thoughts:**

1.  **Architectural Principles:**
    *   **Modularity:** Design components (API, Orchestration, Tools, RAG, Gemini Client) with clear interfaces to allow independent development, testing, and potential future replacement or scaling.
    *   **Simplicity (Start Small):** Avoid over-engineering. Docker is appropriate; K8s is not needed now but the architecture shouldn't preclude future migration if scale demands it.
    *   **Reliability:** Focus on robust error handling, monitoring, and especially the design of reliable custom tools (file I/O, terminal) as these are identified pain points.
    *   **Security:** Treat security as a primary concern, even for a local application. This includes secure handling of API keys (Gemini), input validation to prevent injection attacks (especially for terminal commands), and least-privilege access for file system operations.

2.  **Technology Choices:**
    *   **Backend:** Python/FastAPI (as suggested by Sr Engineer) is a solid choice. Its async nature is well-suited.
    *   **Data:** Vector DB (e.g., ChromaDB, LanceDB) for RAG. Potentially SQLite for simple operational data if needed. Avoid complex database setups initially.
    *   **Containerization:** Docker is the standard and appropriate choice.

3.  **GUI Strategy:**
    *   VSCode Extension vs. Standalone: A VSCode extension offers immediate integration with a developer's workflow and UI components. However, it ties the application tightly to VSCode's architecture and limitations. A standalone application (potentially web-based, e.g., using Electron or Tauri for desktop packaging) offers more control and flexibility but requires more UI development effort.
    *   Consider a hybrid: Backend service providing an API, which could be consumed by *either* a VSCode extension *or* a separate GUI.

4.  **Custom Tool Design (`read_file`, `edit_file`, terminal):**
    *   These are critical and high-risk. Their design needs significant attention.
    *   `edit_file`: Requires careful consideration of atomicity, idempotency (if possible), and rollback/backup mechanisms. Diff-based approaches are likely necessary.
    *   `terminal`: Highest risk. Needs strict sandboxing, input sanitization, and clear limitations on allowed commands or execution scope.
    *   Reliability improvement over Cursor suggests investing in more sophisticated implementation and testing for these tools.

5.  **Long-Term Vision:**
    *   While starting small, the architecture should accommodate future growth in agent capabilities, potential integration with other services, or evolution of the GUI.

**Key Questions:**
*   What is the acceptable level of risk for the terminal interaction feature?
*   How tightly coupled should the backend be to a specific GUI approach (VSCode ext vs. standalone)? Should an API-first approach be prioritized?
*   What specific architectural patterns can best enhance the reliability and testability of the custom tools?
*   Are there any cross-cutting concerns (logging, configuration management, security) that need upfront architectural decisions?
