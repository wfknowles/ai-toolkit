# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial Analysis

**Core Concept:** Develop a local, self-contained application leveraging Gemini for agentic capabilities, including RAG and custom tools, prioritizing a solid foundation and reliability.

**Initial Thoughts:**

1.  **Orchestration Framework:**
    *   Evaluate using existing frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex) vs. building a custom orchestration layer. Frameworks offer pre-built components (RAG, agents, tool integration) but add dependencies and potential abstraction overhead. A custom layer provides more control, aligning with the desire for direct Gemini usage, but requires more initial development.
    *   The orchestration core must manage the flow: user request -> planning -> tool execution -> Gemini interaction -> response generation.

2.  **RAG Integration:**
    *   Choice of Vector Database: For local use, embedded options like ChromaDB or LanceDB are viable. Consider performance, ease of integration, and metadata filtering capabilities.
    *   Data Ingestion Pipeline: How will workspace context (files) be processed, chunked, embedded, and stored in the vector DB?
    *   Retrieval Strategy: Basic similarity search, or more advanced techniques like Hybrid Search or MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) to balance relevance and diversity.

3.  **Agentic Loop Design:**
    *   Define the core agent structure. Will it be a simple ReAct (Reason+Act) style agent, or something more complex involving planning and reflection?
    *   How will the agent maintain state and memory across turns?

4.  **Tool Integration Architecture:**
    *   Tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`, terminal) need a well-defined interface for the orchestrator/agent to call.
    *   Consider security implications, especially for tools interacting directly with the file system or terminal.

5.  **Deployment & Scalability:**
    *   Docker seems appropriate for initial local deployment.
The architecture should be modular enough to potentially scale components independently if needed later (though K8s is overkill now).

**Key Questions:**
*   What is the trade-off between using an existing framework (faster start, more features) vs. a custom build (more control, potentially leaner)?
*   What are the specific requirements for the RAG system (types of queries, required retrieval accuracy)?
*   How complex does the agent's planning and reasoning capability need to be for the MVP?
*   How will the orchestrator handle errors from Gemini or tool execution?
