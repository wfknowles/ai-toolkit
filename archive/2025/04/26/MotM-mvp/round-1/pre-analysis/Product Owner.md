# Product Owner - Initial Analysis

**Core Concept:** Develop a local, Gemini-powered agentic application focused on delivering reliable core features (especially file I/O, terminal interaction) as an improvement over existing tools like Cursor, starting with an MVP and growing sustainably.

**Initial Thoughts:**

1.  **Value Proposition:**
    *   What is the primary user pain point this application solves better than existing solutions (Cursor, standard IDEs + extensions)? Reliability of core agentic actions (`read_file`, `edit_file`, terminal) seems key.
    *   Who is the target user? (Likely developers familiar with AI assistants).
    *   How will we measure success? (Reliability metrics, user satisfaction, task completion efficiency).

2.  **MVP Definition:**
    *   What are the absolute essential features for the first usable version?
        *   Basic chat interface (VSCode extension seems fastest path to MVP).
        *   Reliable `read_file`.
        *   Reliable `edit_file` (even if simplified initially, e.g., inserting code, replacing blocks).
        *   Basic Gemini interaction for code generation/understanding.
        *   Workspace context awareness (basic RAG).
    *   What features are explicitly *out* of scope for MVP? (e.g., complex agentic workflows, advanced terminal interaction, standalone GUI).

3.  **Feature Prioritization (Post-MVP):**
    *   How do we prioritize improvements? Focus on addressing Cursor's limitations (reliability, file system access, terminal interaction) first.
    *   Balance building new features vs. improving the reliability and UX of existing ones.

4.  **User Experience (UX) Considerations:**
    *   How do we make the interaction seamless and intuitive, especially the potentially risky `edit_file` and terminal operations?
    *   How do we provide clear feedback to the user about what the agent is doing, especially during tool use?
    *   How do we handle errors gracefully from the user's perspective?

5.  **Addressing Cursor Limitations:**
    *   Reliability: Needs to be a core focus from day one.
    *   File System Access: Define clear use cases and ensure the implementation is both capable and secure.
    *   Terminal Interaction: Define the scope carefully (specific commands vs. full shell access?) and prioritize safety.

**Key Questions:**
*   What specific, measurable improvements in reliability for `read_file` and `edit_file` define success compared to Cursor?
*   What is the simplest version of terminal interaction that still provides significant value for the MVP?
*   How important is a standalone GUI vs. a VSCode extension for the initial target users?
*   What are the key workflows we want the agent to support reliably in the MVP?
