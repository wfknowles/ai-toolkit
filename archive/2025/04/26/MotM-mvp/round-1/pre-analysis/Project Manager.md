# Project Manager - Initial Analysis

**Core Concept:** Initiate a project to build a local, Gemini-based agentic application, starting with an MVP focused on reliability and core functionalities, ensuring a sustainable development process.

**Initial Thoughts:**

1.  **Scope & Phasing:**
    *   Clearly define the scope of the MVP based on Product Owner priorities. Essential: Backend service, Gemini integration, reliable `read_file`/`edit_file` (initial version), basic context/RAG, VSCode extension interface.
    *   Outline potential phases post-MVP (e.g., enhanced tools, complex agents, terminal integration, standalone GUI).
    *   Need clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

2.  **Team & Resources:**
    *   Identify necessary skills (Python/FastAPI, Gemini SDK, AI/ML - RAG/Agents, VSCode Ext Dev, UX/UI, Testing).
    *   Estimate initial effort for MVP development.
    *   Are there any external dependencies or resource constraints (e.g., API keys, access to specific Gemini models)?

3.  **Timeline & Execution:**
    *   Develop a high-level timeline for the MVP.
    *   Adopt an agile methodology (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) to manage development, allowing for flexibility and iteration, especially given the experimental nature of AI development.
    *   Regular check-ins and demos to ensure alignment and track progress.

4.  **Risks & Mitigation:**
    *   **Technical Risks:**
        *   Reliability of `edit_file`: High risk. Mitigation: Allocate sufficient time for design, implementation, testing; potentially release a simplified version first.
        *   Security of terminal interaction: High risk. Mitigation: Defer feature post-MVP or implement with strict sandboxing and limitations; thorough security review.
        *   Gemini API limitations/changes: Medium risk. Mitigation: Stay updated on SDK/API changes; build adaptable client module.
    *   **Scope Creep:** Medium risk. Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP scope; clear change management process.
    *   **UX Challenges:** Medium risk. Mitigation: Involve AI UX engineer early; user feedback loops.

5.  **Communication & Reporting:**
    *   Establish communication channels for the team.
    *   Define reporting structure and frequency for stakeholders.

**Key Questions:**
*   What are the key dependencies between different components (e.g., does RAG need to be fully ready before the VSCode extension is started)?
*   What is a realistic timeline estimate for delivering the defined MVP?
*   What are the biggest potential blockers to progress?
*   How will we manage the inherent uncertainty and iteration required in developing AI-driven features?
