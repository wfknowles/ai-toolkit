# Interview (Round 3): Principal Architect

**Facilitator:** Welcome. Your R3 pre-analysis focused on establishing foundational architecture, oversight, and security/metrics in distinct phases. Let's discuss how this integrates with the project execution plan.

**Facilitator:** Your Phase 1 (Foundational Architecture in Sprint 0) involves finalizing the API Contract, defining interfaces (Tool Interface), setting up logging/config standards, and initial security definitions. The PM's S0 plan aligns well. How critical is *full agreement* on the API contract and Tool Interface by the end of S0 for parallel development in S1?

**Principal Architect:** It's absolutely critical. Getting sign-off on the API contract (Python Pydantic models for `/chat` request/response, tool schemas) and the internal Tool Interface (likely a Python Protocol or ABC defining how the Orchestrator invokes tools and receives `ToolResult`) by the end of Sprint 0 is paramount. This allows the SSE to start implementing tools against the interface, the AOA/AE to build the orchestrator/agent logic using it, and the UXE to start building the frontend against the API contract, all in parallel during Sprint 1. Any delay or ambiguity here creates significant downstream dependencies and rework.

**Facilitator:** Phase 2 involves Implementation Oversight (S1-4), focusing on ensuring modularity, DI, security standards (esp. path validation), and testing strategies are followed. How will you practically engage in code reviews and advise teams without becoming a bottleneck, given the potentially rapid pace?

**Principal Architect:** The key is selective, high-impact engagement:
1.  **Focus Areas:** Prioritize reviewing critical pieces: the initial DI setup, the Tool Interface implementation, the Tool Executor, the core Orchestrator loop, security-sensitive code like path validation (`validate_path_in_workspace`), and the API layer implementation.
2.  **Asynchronous Reviews:** Primarily rely on asynchronous code reviews (e.g., GitHub Pull Requests). Provide clear, actionable feedback focused on architectural principles and standards.
3.  **Targeted Syncs:** Use short, targeted sync sessions if a review comment requires deeper discussion or clarification, rather than long, open-ended meetings.
4.  **Empowerment:** Ensure the defined standards (logging, config, interfaces) are well-documented so teams can self-serve and apply them consistently. The goal isn't to review every line, but to ensure the core structure is sound and patterns are correctly established early.
5.  **Automated Checks:** Leverage linters and static analysis tools where possible to catch basic standard violations automatically.

**Facilitator:** You flagged the workspace boundary definition and robust path validation as a key architectural concern. The SSE proposed a validation strategy using `pathlib.Path.resolve()` and checking against a configured workspace root. Does this meet the required security standard? Are there edge cases (symlinks, unicode paths, long paths) we need to explicitly test for?

**Principal Architect:** The SSE's proposed strategy is a solid foundation. Using `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=True)` helps handle non-existent components and basic relative path traversal (`..`). Checking the resolved path against a configured, absolute workspace root using `is_relative_to()` (or equivalent) is correct. However, we must ensure:
1.  **Symlink Handling:** `resolve(strict=True)` resolves symlinks. We need to be sure that resolving a symlink *within* the workspace doesn't lead to a path *outside* the workspace. The check against the workspace root *after* resolving should handle this, but it needs explicit testing.
2.  **Configuration Security:** The workspace root configuration itself must be securely managed and not influenceable by user input.
3.  **Testing:** We need explicit test cases covering: standard relative paths, absolute paths (should fail if outside workspace), `../` traversal attempts, symlinks pointing inside and outside the workspace, paths with unicode characters, and potentially maximum path length issues depending on the OS. The Test Engineer will be crucial here.
4.  **Error Handling:** The validation function must clearly signal failure (e.g., raise a specific exception) which the calling tool function/executor must handle appropriately (likely returning an error `ToolResult`).

**Facilitator:** Phase 3 includes a Security Review (S3/S4) and defining/integrating metrics. Who needs to be involved in the security review? What are the 1-2 *most critical* observability metrics we need for the MVP launch?

**Principal Architect:** Security Review (S3/S4): Needs involvement from myself, the SSE (who implemented the core logic), the AOA (orchestration flow), and ideally a dedicated Security Engineer if available within the organization. We need to review the implementation against the defined standards, focusing on path validation, API key handling, dependency vulnerabilities, and potential denial-of-service vectors.

Critical MVP Metrics:
1.  **Tool Execution Success/Failure Rate (per tool):** This is vital for understanding the core reliability. We need to know if `read_file` or `insert_code_snippet` are failing frequently, and why (categorized errors if possible - e.g., file not found, permission denied, invalid input, internal error).
2.  **End-to-End Request Latency (e.g., p50, p90, p99):** Measuring the time from the user sending a message via the `/chat` API to receiving a final response. This gives us a high-level view of performance and user experience.

**Facilitator:** The R2 decisions mentioned a fixed port for backend discovery in the MVP. Is this still the recommended approach, or should we consider alternatives even for the MVP?

**Principal Architect:** For the MVP, a fixed port (defined via configuration) for the backend service is perfectly acceptable and the simplest approach. The VSCode extension connects directly to `http://localhost:<configured_port>`. We avoid the complexity of dynamic service discovery mechanisms (like mDNS or a registration service) which adds unnecessary overhead for this initial stage. We just need to ensure the port is configurable to avoid conflicts and document it clearly.

**Facilitator:** Are there any architectural shortcuts being taken (e.g., monolithic structure, simple ReAct loop) that you foresee needing significant refactoring soon after the MVP?

**Principal Architect:** The main architectural debt is the monolithic structure itself, although we mitigate this with clear internal interfaces (Tool Interface, DI). Post-MVP, as features grow, we might want to extract core services (like the tool execution engine) into separate deployable units, but the interface-driven design makes this feasible without a full rewrite. The simple ReAct loop implemented by the AOA/AE is also MVP tech debt; more complex agent workflows (planning, reflection) would require significant changes there, but that's expected and tied to feature evolution.

**Facilitator:** Any other architectural dependencies, unknowns, or bottlenecks?

**Principal Architect:** Dependency: Timely selection and setup of the CI/CD pipeline in S0 by SSE. Unknowns: How well the chosen logging/metrics aggregation tools (if any specific ones are chosen beyond basic logging) handle the volume and structure of our logs. Bottleneck: Ensuring consistent application of standards across the team requires ongoing communication and reinforcement, potentially slowing things slightly if not managed well.

**Facilitator:** Need for additional SMEs?

**Principal Architect:** Security Engineer for the review in S3/4 is highly recommended. Test Engineer for implementing tests covering the architectural edge cases (path validation, etc.). Close alignment with AOA and SSE throughout.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. That clarifies the architectural oversight and key technical decisions.
