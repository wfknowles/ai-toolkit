# Interview (Round 3): Product Owner

**Facilitator:** Welcome. Your R3 pre-analysis framed the MVP delivery in three value phases: Foundational Reliability (S1-3), Core Workflow Integration/UX (S3-5), and MVP Release/Polish (Final Sprint). Let's ensure this aligns with the technical plan and user needs.

**Facilitator:** Phase 1 focuses on getting `read_file`, `insert_code_snippet`, and basic Q&A working reliably. You stressed rigorous testing of `insert_code_snippet` ACs. What specific acceptance criteria define "reliable" for this tool in the MVP context, considering the known challenges (like line number accuracy)?

**Product Owner:** Reliable `insert_code_snippet` for MVP means:
1.  **Successful Insertion:** Given a valid file path and line number (or unambiguous insertion point like "end of file"), the code is inserted correctly *most* of the time in common scenarios.
2.  **Backup:** A backup (`.bak`) of the original file is created before modification.
3.  **Preview/Confirmation:** The user is *always* shown a preview (diff) of the intended change and must explicitly confirm before the change is applied (this is the main mitigation for line number inaccuracy).
4.  **Graceful Failure:** If insertion fails (e.g., invalid line, file permission error, write error), the original file remains untouched (or restored from backup if the failure happened after backup), and the user receives a clear error message (UX defined).
5.  **Known Limitation Acceptance:** We accept that the *initial suggested* line number from the LLM might be imperfect, hence the mandatory preview/confirm step. The AC isn't perfect LLM line number inference, but a safe and user-controlled insertion process.

**Facilitator:** Phase 2 aims for end-to-end workflow demonstration (Q&A, Insert) and implementing the basic feedback mechanism. How critical is this feedback mechanism for the MVP launch, and what's the simplest version that provides value?

**Product Owner:** The feedback mechanism is highly critical even for the initial MVP. We need to understand immediately how well the core features work for users and where the biggest frustrations lie. The simplest valuable version is likely:
*   Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down buttons on each agent response.
*   Optionally, a short free-text field appearing after a Thumbs Down to capture qualitative feedback ("Why was this response bad?").
*   This feedback needs to be logged on the backend, associated with the conversation turn, for later analysis. It doesn't need complex real-time dashboards for MVP, just reliable data collection.

**Facilitator:** You identified prioritizing bug fixes vs. minor enhancements within MVP phases. What's the guiding principle for making these trade-offs during Sprints 4 and 5 if time gets tight?

**Product Owner:** The guiding principle is **core workflow reliability and usability**. We prioritize fixing bugs that:
1.  **Prevent completion of the core Q&A or Code Insertion workflows.**
2.  **Cause data loss or corruption** (especially critical for `insert_code_snippet`).
3.  **Result in a highly confusing or unusable UI/UX** for the core tasks (e.g., preview diff is broken, confirmation doesn't work).
Minor enhancements (e.g., slightly better prompt phrasing, cosmetic UI tweaks, adding edge-case error handling beyond the most common ones) will be deferred if they jeopardize fixing showstopper bugs impacting the defined MVP scope and ACs. The goal is a *usable and reliable* MVP for the core tasks, not a feature-rich but flaky one.

**Facilitator:** Post-MVP phasing includes reliability hardening, enhanced edits (`edit_file`), advanced RAG, and terminal integration. How firm are these priorities? How will feedback from the MVP launch influence this roadmap?

**Product Owner:** The current post-MVP priorities (Hardening, Edit, RAG, Terminal) represent our best *current* hypothesis based on anticipated user needs and technical progression. However, they are *not* set in stone. Feedback from the MVP launch is paramount and *will* influence the roadmap.
*   If MVP feedback highlights major reliability issues or usability gaps in the *core* features, **Phase 4 (Reliability Hardening)** will expand and might push back other items.
*   If users strongly request broader project context awareness, **Phase 5 (Advanced RAG)** might get prioritized higher.
*   If the `insert_code_snippet` workflow proves too clunky, **Enhanced Edits** might become more urgent.
The MVP feedback loop (usability testing, feedback buttons, direct user interviews) is designed specifically to validate or refute these hypotheses and adjust the post-MVP roadmap accordingly.

**Facilitator:** Are there any potential disconnects between the defined MVP features/workflows and the technical implementation plan proposed by the PM/engineers? Any features that seem underestimated in complexity?

**Product Owner:** The main area requiring close monitoring is the **`insert_code_snippet` UX**. Getting the preview/diff generation and confirmation flow technically correct (SSE/AOA) and user-friendly (UXE) seems complex and involves tight coordination. While the ACs are clear, the implementation effort might be underestimated. The reliability of the LLM generating usable parameters for this, even with prompt tuning (PE), also needs validation early, as per the PE's comments. Otherwise, the technical plan seems reasonably aligned with delivering the MVP features.

**Facilitator:** Any other product-level dependencies, unknowns, or risks?

**Product Owner:** Dependencies: Timely delivery of the VSCode extension UI (UXE) to actually realize the workflows. Unknowns: Actual user adoption/engagement rate post-MVP launch. How quickly users hit limitations of the simple context/RAG. Risks: The biggest risk is failing to meet the core reliability ACs for `insert_code_snippet`, which would severely undermine the MVP's value proposition. Over-promising on the agent's capabilities based on early demos before hardening is another risk.

**Facilitator:** Need for additional SMEs?

**Product Owner:** Test Engineer is crucial for validating ACs. Direct access to target users (developers) for feedback sessions post-MVP launch is essential. Close collaboration with PM (scope/timeline) and UXE (feature usability) remains key.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. That provides a clear product perspective on the MVP goals and priorities.
