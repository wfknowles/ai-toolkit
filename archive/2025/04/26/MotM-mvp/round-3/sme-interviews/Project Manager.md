# Interview (Round 3): Project Manager

**Facilitator:** Welcome. Your R3 pre-analysis provided a detailed sprint-by-sprint breakdown (S0-S5) aiming for an MVP in roughly 6-10 weeks. Let's discuss the dependencies, risks, and resource allocation within this plan.

**Facilitator:** Your plan packs significant work into each sprint, particularly S1-S3 covering core tool implementation, agent logic, and API integration. Does this plan account for the iterative nature of AI development, especially the prompt tuning feedback loop described by the PE?

**Project Manager:** It accounts for it by including specific tasks for prompt refinement and iteration based on testing (e.g., "Refine prompts based on testing" in S4, PE collaboration mentioned in S3). However, the *time allocation* for that iteration within the sprints is an estimate. If early testing (S1/S2) reveals significant challenges in Gemini function calling reliability (as the PE noted), we may need to allocate more PE/AE time in subsequent sprints, potentially by adjusting the scope of *less critical* tasks planned for those sprints or slightly extending the timeline if absolutely necessary. The plan assumes a reasonable level of success with initial prompts, which needs validation.

**Facilitator:** You identified the Test Engineer resource constraint as needing immediate attention. Assuming a Test Engineer joins around Sprint 2 or 3, how does their onboarding and task allocation fit into the existing sprint plans? What are their key priorities?

**Project Manager:** If a Test Engineer joins around S2/S3:
*   **Onboarding (Parallel):** They'll initially need time to understand the requirements, architecture, ACs, and existing code/tests (shadowing SSE/AE/PE). This happens in parallel with their first tasks.
*   **S2/S3 Priority:** Their immediate focus would be on understanding and then taking ownership of the unit tests for the core tools (`read_file`, `insert_code_snippet`) being finalized by the SSE. They'd also start designing/writing integration tests for the API -> Orchestrator -> Tool Execution flow, likely using mocked tools/LLM initially.
*   **S3/S4 Priority:** Develop and execute integration tests for the core workflows (Q&A, Insert) involving the real LLM and tools. They'll work closely with the PE on running and automating the "golden test cases" for prompt evaluation.
*   **S4/S5 Priority:** Focus on end-to-end testing via the VSCode Extension UI, usability testing support (with UXE/PO), regression testing, and validating bug fixes.
Their integration smooths the transition to more robust testing later, but the initial burden of unit testing falls on the SSE in S1/S2 as planned.

**Facilitator:** The plan relies heavily on parallel work streams (Backend, Frontend/UXE, Prompts/AE). What specific mechanisms (ceremonies, tools, communication channels) are planned to ensure tight coordination and prevent integration issues, especially between the backend API and the VSCode extension?

**Project Manager:** Mechanisms for coordination:
1.  **Defined API Contract:** The finalized OpenAPI spec / Pydantic models agreed in S0 is the primary technical contract.
2.  **Regular Syncs:** Bi-weekly (or weekly if needed) dedicated Backend-Frontend sync meetings involving SSE, AOA, UXE, and potentially AE/PA to discuss API integration progress, resolve issues, and demo intermediate results.
3.  **Shared Backlog & Visibility:** Using a shared backlog tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) where dependencies between tasks (e.g., "UXE needs `/chat` endpoint implemented by SSE") are clearly marked and tracked.
4.  **Clear Communication Channels:** Utilizing dedicated Slack/Teams channels for quick questions and clarifications between disciplines.
5.  **Sprint Reviews:** Demonstrating integrated progress (even if partial) during sprint reviews allows for early feedback and course correction.
6.  **Interface Definition:** The Tool Interface definition (PA/AOA/SSE) acts as an internal contract for backend components.

**Facilitator:** Risk management: You noted the timeline is ambitious. Besides the Test Engineer resource constraint, what are the top 1-2 project risks that could derail the ~10-week MVP goal, and what are the primary mitigation strategies?

**Project Manager:** Top Risks & Mitigations:
1.  **Risk: Critical Path Slippage due to AI/LLM Unpredictability:** The core agent/LLM integration (function calling reliability, prompt tuning effort) takes significantly longer than estimated, impacting downstream tasks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Early validation (S1/S2) of function calling with real schemas/tools (even mocked). Build buffer time for PE/AE iteration. Maintain flexibility to de-scope non-critical MVP features if necessary to protect the core timeline/goals (PO alignment needed).
2.  **Risk: Late-Stage Integration Failures:** Major issues discovered during Backend-Frontend integration (S3/S4) or end-to-end testing (S4/S5) require significant rework, delaying the release.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to the API contract from S1. Early, incremental integration demos in sync meetings and sprint reviews. Prioritize integration tests starting S2/S3. Ensure Test Engineer involvement from S2/S3.

**Facilitator:** How will the Definition of Done (DoD) be applied practically at the end of each sprint and for the final MVP release, especially considering the qualitative aspects of AI features (e.g., "reasonable" prompt responses)?

**Project Manager:** DoD Application:
*   **Standard Criteria (Apply Always):** Code implemented, reviewed, merged; Unit tests written and passing; Integration tests (where applicable) passing; Functionality meets ACs defined by PO; Documentation updated.
*   **AI Qualitative Aspects:** This is trickier. For prompt-related work, the DoD includes: Passes agreed-upon "golden test cases" (manual or automated by Test Eng/PE); Response quality reviewed and deemed acceptable by PE/PO for the specific task/sprint goal. We won't aim for perfection, but for meeting the specific quality bar defined for that stage (e.g., "reliably calls correct tool" in early sprints, "handles errors gracefully" later).
*   **MVP Release DoD:** All MVP features meet their ACs; All critical/major bugs fixed (PO sign-off); Performance within acceptable limits (based on metrics defined by PA/AOA); Setup/README tested; Security review completed; Internal demo successful.

**Facilitator:** Any blindspots in the current plan? Any dependencies not explicitly called out?

**Project Manager:** Potential Blindspot: Assuming smooth setup and configuration management across local dev environments for all team members, especially with Docker, env variables, and potential AI service credentials. Needs clear documentation early (SSE task in S0). Dependency: Availability of cloud resources (e.g., Gemini API access) and associated API keys/credentials right from S0/S1.

**Facilitator:** Need for additional SMEs?

**Project Manager:** Test Engineer is the main one. Depending on CI/CD complexity, potentially a DevOps/SRE resource for consultation during setup, but SSE should handle the basics. Security Engineer for the review.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. This clarifies the project management approach to executing the plan.
