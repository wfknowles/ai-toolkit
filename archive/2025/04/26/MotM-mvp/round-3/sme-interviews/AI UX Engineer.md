# Interview (Round 3): AI UX Engineer

**Facilitator:** Welcome. Your R3 pre-analysis detailed the UX work across four phases: UI Structure/Mockups (S0-1), Core Chat UI/API Integration (S1-3), Insertion UX & Workflows (S3-4), and Usability Testing/Polish (S4-5). Let's discuss dependencies and key UX challenges.

**Facilitator:** Phase 1 involves finalizing mockups and selecting a frontend framework. You noted the critical dependency on a stable backend API contract from S0/1. How does potential instability or delay in API finalization impact the initial frontend structure and framework choice?

**AI UX Engineer:** Significant delay or instability in the API contract (especially the `/chat` request/response structure and tool schema format) would be a major blocker for Phase 2 (Core Chat UI/API Integration). We can start building the basic UI components (chat history display, input box) based on the mockups in S1, but we can't effectively implement the API communication layer or accurately display agent responses/context without knowing the final data structures. The choice of framework (React/Vue/Svelte) is less impacted by the exact API *data*, but knowing the *type* of interactions (e.g., streaming responses vs. simple request/response) might slightly influence the choice or setup. A stable contract by end of S1 is essential to avoid significant frontend rework in S2/S3.

**Facilitator:** The `insert_code_snippet` UX (preview/confirmation) is central to the MVP and involves complexity, as noted by the PO. What are the biggest challenges you anticipate in designing and implementing this flow within the VSCode Webview context? How do you ensure the preview accurately reflects the intended change?

**AI UX Engineer:** Challenges for Insertion UX:
1.  **Diff Generation/Display:** Reliably generating an accurate diff between the current file content and the proposed change (based on potentially imprecise line numbers from the LLM) and rendering it clearly within the Webview UI is the main technical challenge. We'll likely need a robust JavaScript diffing library and careful handling of line numbers/offsets. Fetching the relevant file context to show around the change might also require specific backend support via the API.
2.  **Webview Limitations:** VSCode Webviews have certain limitations compared to standard web pages. Ensuring the UI is performant, responsive, and visually consistent within the VSCode environment requires careful testing.
3.  **Clarity and User Trust:** The design must make it crystal clear *what* will change and *where*. The user needs to trust the preview. This involves clear visual cues (highlighting changes), understandable diff formats, and potentially displaying the target filename/line number explicitly.
4.  **State Management:** Managing the state of the confirmation flow (preview shown, user confirmed/rejected) within the frontend application is crucial.
Accuracy relies on: receiving the proposed code and target location from the backend, fetching the current code snippet around that location (possibly via a dedicated API call if needed, or using `read_file`), performing the diff on the frontend, and rendering it accurately.

**Facilitator:** Phase 3 includes designing and implementing user-facing error messages based on backend errors. How do you collaborate with the PE (who designs prompt instructions for errors) and backend engineers (who implement error handling) to ensure messages are consistent, user-friendly, and actionable?

**AI UX Engineer:** Collaboration for Error Messages:
1.  **Shared Error Definitions:** We need a shared understanding (ideally documented alongside the API contract or tool definitions) of the types of errors the backend can produce (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `InvalidLineNumberError`, `PermissionError`, `APIKeyError`, `ToolInternalError`).
2.  **Mapping Backend -> User Message:** Work with the PE to understand *how* the agent should ideally respond based on prompt instructions for each error type. Then, design concise, user-friendly messages for the UI.
3.  **Consistency:** Ensure the language used in UI error messages aligns with the agent's persona and the language suggested in the PE's prompts.
4.  **Actionability:** Where possible, messages should suggest next steps (e.g., "File not found. Please check the path." or "Could not insert code. Try selecting the code block and using the insert command again.").
5.  **Implementation:** The backend API response for an error should ideally include an error code or type that the frontend can use to display the appropriate designed message, rather than just passing raw technical error strings.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned Webview performance. Are there specific concerns for this project (e.g., large code snippets in previews, chat history length)? What mitigation strategies can be employed?

**AI UX Engineer:** Concerns & Mitigations:
*   **Large Diff Previews:** Displaying diffs for very large code insertions could be slow.
    *   Mitigation: Virtualize the diff view (only render visible lines), potentially truncate very large previews with a "show more" option, optimize the diffing algorithm.
*   **Long Chat Histories:** Rendering and maintaining a very long chat history can consume memory and slow down rendering.
    *   Mitigation: Implement virtual scrolling for the chat history view. Potentially limit the number of messages retained in the frontend state (though the full history should remain accessible via backend/state management).
*   **Framework Choice:** Choose a performant frontend framework known to work well in resource-constrained environments like Webviews.
*   **Bundle Size:** Keep the JavaScript bundle size for the Webview small.
Regular performance profiling during development (S2-S4) is important.

**Facilitator:** Phase 4 includes usability testing. What is the minimum viable usability testing we should conduct for the MVP before release, and who should be involved?

**AI UX Engineer:** Minimum Viable Usability Testing (S4/S5):
*   **Participants:** Target users (developers representative of the intended audience), ideally 3-5 individuals not directly involved in the project.
*   **Scope:** Focus on the core MVP workflows: 1) Asking code-related questions (basic Q&A). 2) Generating code and inserting it using the preview/confirm flow. 3) Basic setup/configuration.
*   **Method:** Task-based observation. Give participants specific tasks (e.g., "Ask the agent to explain this function," "Ask the agent to add a print statement here," "Insert the generated code"). Observe their interactions, note points of confusion, measure task success rates.
*   **Facilitation:** UXE facilitates, PO/PM observe. Gather qualitative feedback through think-aloud protocol and brief post-test interviews.
The goal is to identify major usability roadblocks in the core workflows before wider internal release.

**Facilitator:** Any other UX-specific dependencies, unknowns, or risks? Need for specific backend support beyond the main API?

**AI UX Engineer:** Dependencies: Stable API contract (S0/1). Timely delivery of backend functionality supporting the workflows (SSE/AOA/AE in S1-S4). Unknowns: How users will react to the specific preview/confirm interaction model for insertion. How disruptive frequent context/status updates in the UI might be. Risks: Underestimating the complexity of the diff view implementation. Frontend performance issues discovered late. Potential need for a dedicated API endpoint to efficiently fetch file snippets for diff previews if `read_file` proves too coarse.

**Facilitator:** Need for additional SMEs?

**AI UX Engineer:** Close collaboration with PO (requirements, ACs), PE (error messages, agent persona), SSE/AOA (API integration). Test Engineer for testing UI functionality and potentially frontend performance.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. That clarifies the UX plan and its integration points.
