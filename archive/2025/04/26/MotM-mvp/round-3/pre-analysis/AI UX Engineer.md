# AI UX Engineer - Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 2 Analysis & Requirements:** Defined core UX assets (mockups), strategies (insertion UX, context display, error design), and methodologies (framework choice, usability testing). Need to phase UX design and implementation tasks into the project plan.

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps (UX Design & Implementation Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Core UI Structure & Mockups (Sprint 0-1)**
    *   **Milestone:** Initial wireframes/mockups for chat view and insertion preview approved.
    *   **Milestone:** Decision made on frontend framework (React/Vue/Svelte).
    *   **Milestone:** Basic VSCode Extension project setup (parallel w/ SSE).
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Create detailed mockups for chat interface (history, input, status).
        *   Task: Create detailed mockups for `insert_code_snippet` preview/confirmation flow.
        *   Task: Design context visualization element.
        *   Task: Research/Recommend specific UI framework for Webview.
        *   Task: Setup basic VSCode Extension project (manifest, basic webview container).

2.  **Phase 2: Implement Core Chat UI & API Integration (Sprints 1-3)**
    *   **Milestone:** Basic chat interface functional in VSCode extension (displaying mock data or simple backend responses).
    *   **Milestone:** Extension successfully communicates with backend API `/health` and `/chat` endpoints.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Implement chat history display component.
        *   Task: Implement user input component.
        *   Task: Implement basic backend API communication layer (using finalized API Contract).
        *   Task: Implement agent status indicator UI.
        *   Task: Implement context display UI element.

3.  **Phase 3: Implement Insertion UX & Refine Workflows (Sprints 3-4)**
    *   **Milestone:** `insert_code_snippet` preview and confirmation flow fully implemented in UI.
    *   **Milestone:** End-to-end user workflows (Q&A, Insert) are visually functional.
    *   **Milestone:** User-facing error messages designed and implemented.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Implement the `insert_code_snippet` preview component (fetching context, displaying code).
        *   Task: Implement confirmation buttons and logic.
        *   Task: Integrate preview flow with backend API/agent responses.
        *   Task: Design and implement display for error messages received from backend (collab w/ PE).
        *   Task: Implement user feedback mechanism (e.g., thumbs up/down buttons).
        *   Task: (If feasible) Implement Undo UI trigger.

4.  **Phase 4: Usability Testing & Polish (Sprints 4-5)**
    *   **Milestone:** Initial usability testing conducted and feedback gathered.
    *   **Milestone:** UI polished based on feedback; bugs fixed.
    *   **Milestone:** Setup/installation instructions user-tested.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Conduct informal usability tests on core workflows.
        *   Task: Iterate on UI based on feedback (minor adjustments for MVP).
        *   Task: Fix UI bugs.
        *   Task: Design and document simple setup/config UX (API key entry, connection status).

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Dependency on a stable backend API contract early on (Sprint 0/1) is critical for frontend progress.
*   Webview performance needs monitoring throughout development.
*   Need clear communication channel with backend devs (SSE/AOA/AE) regarding API data formats and expected behavior.
*   Ensuring the insertion preview accurately reflects what will happen is paramount for user trust.
