# Project Manager - Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 2 Analysis & Requirements:** Have initial backlog ideas, Sprint 0 plan, defined ceremonies, DoD, risk log, communication plan. Need to structure this into a coherent project plan with phases and milestones aligned with other SMEs.

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps (Project Execution Focus):**

*(Leveraging estimates and phasing from R1/R2, structuring into Sprints)*

*   **Sprint 0: Setup & Foundation (1-2 weeks)**
    *   **Goal:** Establish project infrastructure, finalize API, plan Sprint 1.
    *   **Milestones:** Git repo & structure setup; Basic CI running; Docker runnable; API Contract v1.0 Agreed; Config/Logging setup; Sprint 1 Backlog Ready.
    *   **Key Tasks:** Setup repo, project structure, CI, Dockerfile, basic FastAPI app, health check, finalize API spec, setup config/logging, groom Sprint 1 backlog.

*   **Sprint 1: Core Backend & Tools - Part 1 (1-2 weeks)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement reliable `read_file`, start `insert_code_snippet`, basic agent/orchestrator structure.
    *   **Milestones:** `read_file` implemented & unit tested; Basic Orchestrator/Agent loop structure in place; `insert_code_snippet` implementation started.
    *   **Key Tasks:** Implement `read_file` + tests; Implement workspace validation; Start `insert_code_snippet` (backup, basic insert); Implement basic Orchestrator/Agent/GeminiClient skeletons; Define Tool Interface; Start VSCode Ext structure (parallel task).

*   **Sprint 2: Tools & Integration - Part 2 (1-2 weeks)**
    *   **Goal:** Complete reliable `insert_code_snippet`, integrate tools with orchestrator.
    *   **Milestones:** `insert_code_snippet` fully implemented & unit tested; Tools integrated via interface.
    *   **Key Tasks:** Finish `insert_code_snippet` + tests; Implement Tool Executor; Integrate tools w/ Orchestrator; Refine Agent logic for tool calls; Implement context prepper; Continue VSCode Ext UI (parallel task).

*   **Sprint 3: Agent & API Integration (1-2 weeks)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement core agent logic (function calling), API endpoint, basic error handling.
    *   **Milestones:** Agent makes successful function calls for tools; `/chat` API endpoint functional; Basic tool error handling implemented.
    *   **Key Tasks:** Implement Gemini function call parsing/handling; Implement tool result formatting; Implement basic System Prompt error handling policies (PE collab); Implement `/chat` endpoint + integration tests; Implement orchestrator error handling (catch/standardize); Start VSCode Ext API integration (parallel task).

*   **Sprint 4: End-to-End Workflow & UX - Part 1 (1-2 weeks)**
    *   **Goal:** Achieve functional end-to-end workflows for Q&A and Code Insertion; Implement core UX.
    *   **Milestones:** Code Q&A workflow testable end-to-end; Code Insertion workflow testable end-to-end (incl. preview/confirm UX).
    *   **Key Tasks:** Integrate VSCode Ext with backend API; Implement insertion preview/confirm UI (UXE collab); Implement context visualization UI; Conduct initial internal usability tests; Refine prompts based on testing.

*   **Sprint 5: Polish, Testing & Release Prep (1-2 weeks)**
    *   **Goal:** Stable MVP build meeting ACs, ready for internal release.
    *   **Milestones:** MVP meets DoD; Key bugs fixed; Setup documented; Internal Demo successful.
    *   **Key Tasks:** Focused bug fixing based on testing; Implement metrics logging; (Investigate/Implement Undo); Write/finalize README documentation; Prepare demo.

**Methodology Notes:**
*   Maintain flexibility; sprint goals might adjust based on findings (esp. AI task estimates).
*   Ensure Test Engineer (once onboarded) is integrated into sprints for test case development and execution.
*   Schedule regular (e.g., bi-weekly) backend/frontend syncs.
*   Schedule Security Review around Sprint 3/4.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Timeline (~6-10 weeks) still feels ambitious but achievable if focus remains tight on MVP scope.
*   Resource constraint (Test Engineer availability) needs addressing ASAP.
*   Need to ensure clear task breakdown and ownership in the backlog tool.
