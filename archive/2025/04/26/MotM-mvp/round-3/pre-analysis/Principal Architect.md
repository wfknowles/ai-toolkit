# Principal Architect - Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 2 Analysis & Requirements:** Have definitions for architecture diagrams, API contract, interfaces, cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, config, tech debt), and key decisions (startup config for workspace root, correlation IDs). Need to ensure these architectural elements are phased correctly into the project plan.

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps (Architecture & Standards Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Architecture Definition (Sprint 0)**
    *   **Milestone:** API Contract v1.0 defined and agreed.
    *   **Milestone:** High-Level System Architecture Diagram created.
    *   **Milestone:** Core internal interface definitions (Tool Interface) drafted.
    *   **Milestone:** Logging and Configuration standards defined and implemented in initial structure.
    *   **Milestone:** Initial Security Standards defined.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Lead/Participate in API Contract finalization working session.
        *   Task: Create System Architecture Diagram.
        *   Task: Define Tool Interface Protocol/ABC (AOA collab).
        *   Task: Define Logging standards (JSON, correlation ID) and setup initial config (SSE collab).
        *   Task: Define Config standards (Pydantic Settings, env vars) and setup initial structure (SSE collab).
        *   Task: Document initial Security Standards (API key handling, path validation approach).
        *   Task: Document accepted MVP Tech Debt (Simplified RAG, Agent Logic).

2.  **Phase 2: Implementation Oversight & Review (Sprints 1-4)**
    *   **Milestone:** Key architectural patterns (Modularity, DI) are being followed in implementation.
    *   **Milestone:** Security standards are being implemented correctly.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Review core service implementations (Orchestrator, Tool Executor, API Layer) for adherence to modular design and interface contracts.
        *   Task: Participate in code reviews, focusing on architectural consistency, security implementation (esp. path validation), and proper use of logging/config.
        *   Task: Review unit and integration test strategies to ensure architectural boundaries are respected (e.g., proper mocking).
        *   Task: Advise on solutions if architectural challenges or unexpected coupling arises.

3.  **Phase 3: Security Review & Metrics Definition (Sprints 3-5)**
    *   **Milestone:** Initial security review completed.
    *   **Milestone:** Key observability metrics defined and integrated.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Facilitate/participate in security review with Security Engineer.
        *   Task: Define specific metrics for tracking (tool success rates, latencies - collab w/ PO, AOA).
        *   Task: Ensure metrics are implemented correctly in the backend.
        *   Task: Review backend discovery mechanism (fixed port for MVP) and document.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Ensuring the architectural standards (modularity, interfaces, logging, etc.) are consistently applied throughout development, not just defined upfront.
*   Need for proactive engagement in code reviews to catch deviations early.
*   Balancing architectural purity with MVP pragmatism â€“ ensuring standards don\'t unduly slow down delivery.
*   Clearly defining the workspace boundary and ensuring the path validation logic implemented by SSE is sufficiently robust is a key architectural concern.
