# Product Owner - Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 2 Analysis & Requirements:** Have detailed MVP features, ACs, workflows, feedback plan, metrics definitions, and post-MVP priorities. Need to ensure the project plan delivers this defined value incrementally.

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps (Product Value Delivery Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Reliability (Corresponds roughly to Sprints 1-3)**
    *   **Goal:** Deliver the core reliable tools (`read_file`, `insert_code_snippet`) and basic Q&A.
    *   **Milestones:**
        *   Milestone: `read_file` tool meets ACs and is integrated.
        *   Milestone: `insert_code_snippet` tool meets ACs (including backup, preview, confirm) and is integrated.
        *   Milestone: Basic Code Q&A workflow (using active file context) is functional.
    *   **Key Features Delivered:** Reliable file reading, reliable code insertion, basic context awareness.

2.  **Phase 2: Core Workflow Integration & UX (Corresponds roughly to Sprints 3-5)**
    *   **Goal:** Integrate backend capabilities into a usable VSCode extension experience for the key workflows.
    *   **Milestones:**
        *   Milestone: VSCode extension chat UI implemented.
        *   Milestone: Code Q&A workflow fully demonstrable end-to-end (UI -> Agent -> UI).
        *   Milestone: Code Generation & Insertion workflow fully demonstrable end-to-end.
        *   Milestone: Basic user feedback mechanism implemented.
        *   Milestone: Reliability metrics are being logged.
    *   **Key Features Delivered:** End-to-end user workflows, basic usability, initial feedback channel.

3.  **Phase 3: MVP Release & Polish (Corresponds roughly to final Sprint)**
    *   **Goal:** Prepare a stable, documented MVP for initial internal release/testing.
    *   **Milestones:**
        *   Milestone: Key bugs identified during development/testing are fixed.
        *   Milestone: Setup/Installation process is documented and tested.
        *   Milestone: MVP meets defined ACs for all features.
        *   Milestone: Internal demo completed.
    *   **Key Features Delivered:** Stable MVP build, basic documentation.

**Post-MVP Phasing (Conceptual):**
*   **Phase 4:** Reliability Hardening & Enhanced Edits (Address feedback, improve `edit_file` capabilities).
*   **Phase 5:** Advanced RAG (Vector DB integration).
*   **Phase 6:** Safe Terminal Integration.
*   **Phase 7+:** Standalone GUI, Complex Agent Planning, etc.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Ensuring sprint goals align with these value delivery phases.
*   Making sure the ACs for `insert_code_snippet` reliability are rigorously tested before claiming the milestone.
*   Prioritizing bug fixes vs. minor enhancements within the MVP phases.
*   Need to factor in time for incorporating feedback from early usability testing into later MVP sprints.
