# AI Agent Engineer - Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Based on Round 2 Analysis & Requirements:** Have definitions for agent assets (code schemas), logic implementation (ReAct via function calling), strategies (param validation), and methodologies (state management, testing). Need to phase agent development tasks.

**Initial Milestones/Phases/Steps (Agent Implementation Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Core Agent Setup (Sprint 0-1)**
    *   **Milestone:** Tool schemas defined in Python code.
    *   **Milestone:** Basic agent loop structure integrated with Orchestrator skeleton.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Implement Python representations of tool schemas (`read_file`, `insert_code_snippet`) in `app/tools/schemas.py` (collab w/ PE).
        *   Task: Integrate basic agent logic call point within Orchestrator service (AOA collab).
        *   Task: Setup basic Gemini Client to pass prompt + tool schemas.

2.  **Phase 2: Function Calling & Tool Integration (Sprints 1-3)**
    *   **Milestone:** Agent correctly requests function calls for `read_file` and `insert_code_snippet` based on simple prompts.
    *   **Milestone:** Agent correctly parses parameters from LLM response.
    *   **Milestone:** Agent correctly formats `ToolResult` (Success) for follow-up LLM call.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Implement logic in Orchestrator/Agent module to extract function call name/params from Gemini response.
        *   Task: Implement basic parameter validation (types, non-empty) within Orchestrator/Agent module.
        *   Task: Implement logic to format successful `ToolResult` data into function response format for Gemini API.
        *   Task: Test function calling flow with mocked tools initially.
        *   Task: Integrate with real tool execution via Orchestrator.
        *   Task: Refine prompts (PE collab) to improve function call reliability.

3.  **Phase 3: Error Handling & State Management (Sprints 2-4)**
    *   **Milestone:** Agent correctly handles documented tool errors passed back via `ToolResult` based on System Prompt instructions.
    *   **Milestone:** Conversation history is correctly passed between turns.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Implement logic to handle error `ToolResult` (format into function response).
        *   Task: Test agent error handling behavior against golden test cases (collab w/ PE, Test Eng).
        *   Task: Implement history management logic within Orchestrator (passing history from API request).
        *   Task: Implement logging for agent decisions, tool calls requested, parameters (masked), and latency.

4.  **Phase 4: Workflow Testing & Tuning (Sprints 4-5)**
    *   **Milestone:** Agent performs reliably for core MVP workflows (Q&A, Code Insertion) in integration tests.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Task: Participate in integration testing, debugging agent behavior.
        *   Task: Tune prompts (PE collab) based on workflow testing results.
        *   Task: Measure and analyze agent/LLM latency.

**Initial Thoughts/Concerns:**
*   Debugging the interaction between the LLM\'s function calling and our backend logic will require good logging and potentially specialized testing approaches.
*   Latency introduced by the multi-step ReAct flow needs careful monitoring.
*   Ensuring the LLM consistently generates parameters that pass both basic validation and the tool\'s stricter validation.
