# Report: Planning an Agentic Workflow using the MotM Orchestrator

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Project:** MotM Workflow & Agentic System Design

## 1. Overview

This report analyzes the feasibility of using the newly developed MotM (Meeting of the Minds) orchestrator structure to plan and design a new, high-quality agentic workflow similar to the MotM process itself. It addresses what concept to feed the MotM workflow, what specific inclusions are necessary to ensure quality and extensibility, and provides a recommended concept prompt.

## 2. Using MotM to Design an Agentic Workflow

The MotM workflow simulates a multi-stakeholder process for analysis, requirements gathering, and planning. This makes it potentially well-suited for designing *other* complex systems, including new agentic workflows.

*   **Feasibility:** It is feasible. By feeding the MotM workflow a concept focused on designing a new agent, the simulated SMEs (Prompt Engineer, UX Designer, Project Manager, potentially an 'Agent Architect' persona) can collectively analyze the requirements, plan the components, define interfaces, and outline the operational flow of the target agentic system.
*   **Quality:** The quality of the output (the design for the new agent) will depend heavily on:
    *   The clarity and detail of the initial concept provided.
    *   The effectiveness of the simulated SME personas within the Step Prompts (how well they represent their respective expertise).
    *   The thoroughness of the analysis, requirements, and roadmap generation steps (Steps 7, 9, 13).
*   **Extensibility Focus:** To ensure the *designed* agent is extensible, this requirement must be explicitly included in the initial concept and likely emphasized during the simulated R2 (Requirements) and R3 (Roadmap/Planning) phases.

## 3. Input Considerations for Designing an Agentic Workflow

When feeding the MotM orchestrator a concept aimed at designing a new agentic workflow, consider including:

*   **Clear Goal:** State the primary function and objective of the target agentic workflow (e.g., "Design an agent that can autonomously refactor Python code based on user-defined style guides").
*   **Key Capabilities:** List the essential high-level capabilities the target agent must possess (e.g., "Code parsing, style guide interpretation, code modification, testing invocation, reporting").
*   **Core Components (Initial Thoughts):** If you have initial ideas about the structure (e.g., "Likely needs an orchestrator, code analysis module, refactoring module, testing module"), include them as a starting point for the SMEs.
*   **Target Environment/Tools:** Specify the intended execution environment and any known tools the agent will need to interact with (e.g., "Runs locally, interacts with filesystem, Git, potentially a specific linter tool").
*   **Quality Attributes:** Explicitly mention desired qualities:
    *   **Extensibility:** "The design must prioritize extensibility, allowing easy addition of new refactoring rules or support for different languages in the future."
    *   **Reliability:** "The agent must reliably perform refactoring without breaking code functionality."
    *   **Performance:** Define any performance considerations (though this might be secondary for an initial design).
    *   **Maintainability:** "The resulting components (prompts, logic) should be maintainable."
*   **Inclusion of MotM (Meta-Reflection):** If you want the design process to consider using the *existing* MotM structure *within* the new agent (e.g., for a planning sub-module), explicitly state this: "The design should evaluate the feasibility of incorporating a simplified MotM-like structure for its own internal planning or decision-making processes."

## 4. Unasked Questions & Considerations

When planning a new agentic workflow using MotM, consider:

*   **Level of Abstraction:** How detailed should the MotM output be? Should it produce executable prompt skeletons for the new agent, or just high-level design documents? (Specify this in the concept).
*   **SME Personas:** Are the current MotM personas (Prompt Engineer, UX Designer, Project Manager) sufficient? Might you need an "AI Safety Engineer," "Software Architect," or "Testing Specialist" persona added to the simulation for a robust agent design? (This would require modifying Step 1 and adding logic/prompts).
*   **Evaluation Criteria:** How will the *output* of the MotM run (the design for the new agent) be evaluated? Define success criteria for the meta-design process itself.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Does the target agent require human oversight or interaction points? This needs to be specified in the concept.

## 5. Recommended Concept Prompt

Here is a sample concept designed to leverage the MotM workflow to plan a new, extensible agentic system, incorporating the points above:

Initial Concept for MotM Workflow:
Goal: Design a detailed plan and core architecture for a new, extensible, and reliable agentic workflow named "CodeMaestro". CodeMaestro's primary function is to autonomously refactor Python code modules based on user-provided configuration (e.g., target style guide like PEP 8, specific refactoring rules).

Key Capabilities Required for CodeMaestro:
Accept user input specifying target code file(s) and configuration (style guide, rules).
Parse and understand the structure and dependencies of the target Python code.
Analyze the code against the specified configuration to identify refactoring opportunities.
Plan a sequence of refactoring actions.
Reliably execute code modifications using safe file editing techniques.
Invoke unit tests (assuming a predefined test command) to verify refactoring did not break functionality.
Report on actions taken, issues encountered, and test results.
Initial Component Ideas (for SME consideration):
Orchestrator/Main Loop
Code Parser/Analyzer Module
Refactoring Rule Interpreter Module
Code Editor Module (using filesystem tools)
Test Invocation Module
Reporting Module
Target Environment & Tools:
Local execution environment (e.g., within Cursor or similar).
Requires access to filesystem (read_file, edit_file).
Requires ability to run terminal commands (for testing).
Mandatory Quality Attributes:
Extensibility: The core design MUST allow for straightforward addition of new refactoring rules, support for different style guides, and potential future expansion to other languages. Define clear interfaces between modules.
Reliability: The agent must avoid corrupting code or introducing errors. Prioritize safe edits and verification.
Maintainability: Component prompts and logic should be well-documented and structured.
Meta-Considerations:
The MotM output should include detailed descriptions of each CodeMaestro component, their interactions, interface contracts (similar to MotM's own contract), and a high-level roadmap/backlog for implementation. Include placeholder prompt structures for key CodeMaestro components.
Evaluate the potential use of a simplified MotM-like simulation within CodeMaestro itself for its internal planning phase (Capability 4).
Evaluation: The success of this MotM run will be judged on the clarity, completeness, feasibility, and demonstrated extensibility of the resulting CodeMaestro design plan and architecture.
