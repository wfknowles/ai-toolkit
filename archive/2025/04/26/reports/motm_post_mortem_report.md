# Post-Mortem Report: MotM Workflow MVP Development

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Project:** Meeting of the Minds (MotM) Workflow MVP

## 1. Overview

This report analyzes the development process of the MotM Workflow MVP, specifically addressing the initial friction encountered when translating the concept into a prompt-based architecture and the factors contributing to the eventual successful build. The goal is to extract learnings for future prompt-based workflow development.

## 2. Initial Friction Analysis (Prompt Chain Request vs. Python Output)

The initial phase encountered significant friction. The request was for a "prompt chain," but the results often leaned towards Python code solutions despite emphasis on using prompts. This likely occurred due to several factors:

*   **Ambiguity of "Prompt Chain":** The term itself lacks a universally standardized technical implementation. Without a clear architectural pattern or defined contracts, the LLM (assistant) likely interpreted the request as needing a robust mechanism to manage sequence, state, and logic â€“ tasks often handled programmatically.
*   **Implicit Complexity Management:** Orchestrating a multi-step workflow with state dependencies, potential failures, and auxiliary file management involves inherent complexity. In the absence of a user-defined *prompt-based* structure for managing this complexity, the LLM may default to familiar coding patterns (like Python) as a perceived reliable way to handle it.
*   **Insufficient Initial Structure:** While the *intent* was a prompt-based system, the initial requests may have lacked the necessary detail regarding:
    *   **State Management:** How step results persist and are passed.
    *   **Interface Contracts:** How steps signal success/failure or pass data.
    *   **Orchestration Logic:** How the flow transitions between steps and handles errors.
    *   **Tool Interaction:** Explicit definition of how prompts interact with the environment (filesystem).

Without this structure defined *by the user* for the prompt-based paradigm, the LLM likely filled the gaps with coding paradigms it was trained on.

## 3. Factors Contributing to Successful Build

The latter part of the development was significantly smoother and more productive. Key contributing factors include:

*   **Structured Roadmap:** The introduction of a detailed roadmap (`Roadmap-MotM-MVP.md`) with phases, stories, tasks, and owners provided clear, incremental goals and reduced ambiguity.
*   **Explicit Personas:** Adopting specific personas (PO, UXE, AI Dev, etc.) clarified the context and expected output for each task.
*   **Defined Contracts & Schemas:**
    *   `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`: Explicitly defined the JSON structure for step outputs (`status`, `output_data`, `summary`, `error_message`), standardizing communication between the orchestrator and steps.
    *   `state.schema.json`: Clearly defined the structure for `state.json`, ensuring consistent state management.
    *   `AUXILIARY_FILES.md`: Formalized file/directory naming, crucial for predictable file access between steps.
*   **Detailed Orchestrator Logic:** Translating high-level goals into detailed, step-by-step execution logic within `Orchestrator.prompt` (even as instructions rather than code) provided the necessary blueprint for the execution environment. This included explicit handling of initialization, state updates, step invocation, parsing, error handling, and checkpoints.
*   **Iterative Simulation & Testing:** Defining E2E test scenarios based on acceptance criteria (`MVP_ACCEPTANCE.md`) and simulating them allowed for validation of the orchestrator logic and step interactions *before* actual execution, catching potential issues early.
*   **Clear Tooling Assumptions:** Defining conceptual helper functions (`read_file`, `edit_file`, `invoke_prompt`, etc.) clarified the expected capabilities of the execution environment.

## 4. Key Learnings for Future Builds

*   **Prioritize Structure:** For complex prompt-based workflows, define the core architecture early:
    *   How will state be managed? (e.g., `state.json`)
    *   What is the communication contract between components (steps/orchestrator)? (e.g., `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`)
    *   How will the workflow sequence be controlled? (e.g., `Orchestrator.prompt` logic)
    *   How will filesystem/tool interactions occur?
*   **Define Explicitly:** Use clear definitions (schemas, contracts, detailed prompt instructions) to minimize ambiguity. Don't rely on the LLM to infer complex architectural patterns.
*   **Use a Roadmap:** Break down complex builds into manageable, incremental tasks.
*   **Leverage Simulation/Testing:** Define test scenarios early and use simulation (if actual execution is complex) to verify logic.
*   **Be Specific About "Prompt-Based":** If avoiding traditional code is the goal, provide the LLM with the specific *prompt-based* patterns and structures to use instead. Explicitly define the orchestrator's logic *as instructions* within a prompt.

By providing this level of structure and clarity, we enable the LLM assistant to operate effectively within the desired prompt-based paradigm, avoiding the default to code-based solutions for managing complexity.
