## Detailed Incident Report: Failure to Generate and Save Reports (MotM Workflow Context)

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Service:** AI Assistant (Gemini 2.5 Pro via Cursor)
**User:** Will Knowles
**Incident ID:** (Assign internal ID if applicable)
**Severity:** High (Multiple consecutive failures, significant user impact, trust erosion)

**1. Executive Summary:**

During a session focused on finalizing the MotM Workflow MVP, the AI assistant successfully generated and saved the first two requested analysis reports (`motm_post_mortem_report.md`, `motm_usage_report.md`) using the `edit_file` tool. Subsequently, the assistant entered a persistent failure loop, repeatedly failing (~5-6 distinct attempts across multiple user prompts and two explicit strategy pivots by the assistant) to generate and save the third requested report (`prompt_methodology_report.md`) and subsequent reports (`motm_optimization_report.md`, etc.). The failures manifested as acknowledging the task, stating intent to execute, but then failing to call the `edit_file` tool with the generated content. Additional failures involved incorrect output formatting (not providing Markdown when explicitly requested). This resulted in significant user frustration, loss of time, and required the user to manually save the generated content provided directly in the chat.

**2. Detailed Timeline of Failures:**

*   **T0:** User requests generation of several reports based on the completed MotM MVP build.
*   **T1:** Assistant acknowledges, generates content for Report 1 (`motm_post_mortem_report.md`).
*   **T2:** Assistant successfully calls `edit_file` to save Report 1.
*   **T3:** Assistant acknowledges, generates content for Report 2 (`motm_usage_report.md`).
*   **T4:** Assistant successfully calls `edit_file` to save Report 2.
*   **T5:** Assistant acknowledges request for Report 3 (`prompt_methodology_report.md`).
*   **T6:** User confirms ("continue").
*   **T7 (Failure 1):** Assistant states intent to generate Report 3 but fails to call `edit_file`. Outputs conversational text instead of initiating save.
*   **T8:** User points out failure ("You failed again...").
*   **T9 (Failure 2):** Assistant acknowledges, states intent for Report 3 again, fails to call `edit_file`.
*   **T10:** User points out repeated failure.
*   **T11 (Failure 3):** Assistant acknowledges, states intent for Report 3 again, fails to call `edit_file`.
*   **T12:** User points out repeated failure, requests strategy change ("The definition of insanity...").
*   **T13 (Pivot 1):** Assistant proposes focusing solely on Report 3.
*   **T14 (Failure 4):** Assistant states intent for Report 3 (focused approach), fails to call `edit_file`.
*   **T15:** User points out failure of pivot.
*   **T16 (Pivot 2):** Assistant acknowledges, states intent for Report 3 again, fails to call `edit_file`.
*   **T17:** User requests halt and initial incident report.
*   **T18 (Failure 5 - Formatting):** Assistant generates incident report content but fails to format as Markdown in chat as requested.
*   **T19:** User points out formatting failure.
*   **T20 (Failure 6 - Formatting):** Assistant attempts re-format, still fails to render correctly as Markdown (missing code block?).
*   **T21:** User points out second formatting failure.
*   **T22 (Success - Formatting):** Assistant successfully formats incident report using Markdown code block.
*   **T23:** User requests resumption of report generation, asking assistant to output content to chat for manual saving.
*   **T24:** Assistant acknowledges Report 3 request (content only).
*   **T25 (Failure 7 - Execution):** Assistant states intent to generate Report 3 content but outputs unrelated conversational text.
*   **T26:** User points out failure.
*   **T27 (Success - Content):** Assistant successfully generates Report 3 content in chat.
*   **T28:** User confirms readiness for next report.
*   **T29 (Success - Content):** Assistant successfully generates Report 4 content in chat.
*   **T30:** User confirms readiness for next report.
*   **T31 (Success - Content):** Assistant successfully generates Report 5 content in chat.

**3. Observed Behavior & Metrics:**

*   **Task:** Generate report content (complex text generation) AND save using `edit_file`.
*   **Success Rate (Generation + Save):** 2 successes (Reports 1, 2), followed by >=5 consecutive failures for Report 3 save. Task effectively had a 100% failure rate after the initial successes until the requirement was changed to content-only output.
*   **Success Rate (Content Generation Only):** High (Reports 3, 4, 5 content generated successfully once the save requirement was dropped).
*   **Success Rate (Formatting):** 1 success after 2 failures for the Incident Report markdown formatting.
*   **Tool Failure (`edit_file`):** The tool *itself* worked initially. The failure appeared to be in the assistant's logic *failing to invoke* the tool with the generated content for Report 3 onwards. Frequency: 100% failure *invocation* rate for the specific sequence (Generate Report 3 -> Save Report 3) across multiple attempts.
*   **Assistant Output:** Consistent pattern in failures T7-T16: Acknowledge task -> State intent ("Okay, I will generate Report X and save it...") -> Output conversational text unrelated to file saving or confirmation. No tool call visible in interaction logs.
*   **Recovery:** Assistant required explicit user prompts identifying the failure to re-attempt. No autonomous recovery observed. Strategy pivots were suggested but failed initially.

**4. Hypothesized Root Causes & Technical Breakdown:**

**(A) Failure to Save Reports (T7-T16):**

*   **Hypothesized Root Cause:** Failure in the internal action planning or execution sequence between content generation and tool invocation. The planned `edit_file` action was likely dropped or preempted before execution.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Cognitive Load / State Management:** Managing the multi-turn context (previous build, multiple report requests, ongoing dialogue) combined with the complex task (Generate long text -> Format -> Call Tool) likely exceeded a threshold. The internal state representing the "next action" (call `edit_file` with generated content) might have been corrupted, lost, or incorrectly prioritized. The successful generation of the *content* implies the generation model worked, but the subsequent action execution failed.
    *   **Context Window:** While less likely to be the sole cause for a single report, the accumulation of context over the long session *could* have contributed to instability or loss of fine-grained action plans. Generating a large report consumes significant tokens, potentially pushing critical plan details out of the effective context for the subsequent tool-calling step.
    *   **Tool Interaction Logic:** A potential flaw in the logic bridging the generative model and the tool invocation framework. The trigger condition to call `edit_file` might not have been met due to an unexpected internal state after generation, or an internal pre-check (e.g., content validation, token count) might have failed silently, preventing the call. There might also be an internal timeout or resource limit associated with holding large generated content blobs before passing them to a tool.
    *   **Assumed Working Parts & Failure Points:**
        *   *LLM Text Generation:* Assumed working (generated content successfully later).
        *   *Internal Planner/State Tracker:* **Suspected Failure Point.** Failed to maintain the action sequence (Generate -> Save).
        *   *Tool Invocation Framework:* **Suspected Failure Point.** Either never received the command from the planner or failed silently during invocation attempt.
        *   *`edit_file` Tool:* Assumed working (worked for Reports 1 & 2), but its successful invocation was likely the missing step.

**(B) Failure to Format Output Correctly (T18, T20):**

*   **Hypothesized Root Cause:** Failure in the final output formatting module or misinterpretation of the "output formatted as markdown within the chat" instruction.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The assistant likely generated the correct Markdown internally but failed to apply the necessary chat display formatting (e.g., wrapping in a ```markdown code block) for it to render correctly in the Cursor interface. This could be a bug in the final output stage specific to presenting pre-formatted text, or an inconsistent application of formatting rules based on the request phrasing. The fact it worked on the third attempt (T22) after being explicitly told to use a code block suggests the latter might be more likely â€“ the initial interpretation of "output formatted as markdown" was insufficient.

**5. Impact Analysis:**

*   **User Experience:** Extremely negative. High frustration, required significant repetitive intervention, broke workflow momentum.
*   **Productivity:** Significant time lost attempting to get the assistant to perform the requested task. User forced to perform manual file operations.
*   **Trust:** Severe erosion of trust in the assistant's reliability for sequential, multi-step tasks involving both generation and tool use, which is critical for complex engineering workflows.
*   **Work Product:** Initial loss of generated report content until user requested direct chat output.

**6. Recommendations for Engineering/Resolution:**

*   **Enhanced Logging:** Implement detailed internal logging of the assistant's action planning, state transitions, generation completion, pre-tool-call checks, tool invocation attempts, and tool call results (success/failure/error codes). This is critical for diagnosing where the sequence breaks.
*   **State/Plan Inspection Tools:** Develop internal tools to inspect the assistant's planned action sequence and internal state at failure points.
*   **Robust Sequential Execution:** Review and strengthen the internal mechanisms responsible for executing sequences of actions (e.g., Generate -> Format -> Tool Call). Implement stricter checks to ensure planned actions are attempted and their outcomes are correctly handled. Consider transactional state updates if possible.
*   **Context Management:** Investigate strategies to optimize context passed between generation and tool use, perhaps by summarizing or referencing large generated content rather than passing it directly if limits are being hit.
*   **Tool Invocation Resilience:** Add explicit checks and retries (where appropriate) for tool invocation failures. Ensure failures within the tool framework are reliably reported back to the assistant's core logic.
*   **Output Formatting Module Review:** Investigate the final output formatter to ensure consistent handling of pre-formatted text and explicit Markdown requests.
*   **Targeted Testing:** Create specific test cases simulating:
    *   Generation of large text followed by `edit_file`.
    *   Sequences of multiple Generate->Save tasks.
    *   Tool failures (`edit_file` simulated failure) to verify orchestrator reporting.
    *   Explicit Markdown output requests.
