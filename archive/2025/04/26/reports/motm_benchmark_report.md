# Architecture and QA Benchmark Report: MotM Workflow MVP

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Project:** Meeting of the Minds (MotM) Workflow MVP

## 1. Overview

This report analyzes the architecture of the developed MotM Workflow MVP, derives its key qualities, and proposes how these insights can be converted into benchmarks or validation workflows for quality assurance (QA) of future prompt-based workflow development.

## 2. MotM MVP Architecture Analysis

The MotM MVP implements a structured, prompt-based workflow orchestration system. Its key architectural components and characteristics are:

*   **Centralized Orchestrator (`Orchestrator.prompt`):** A single prompt file containing detailed natural language instructions that define the main control flow, state management logic, step invocation, response parsing, error handling, and user interaction points (checkpoints). It acts as the "brain" of the workflow.
*   **Modular Step Prompts (`step-*.prompt`):** Each step in the workflow is encapsulated in its own prompt file. These steps are designed to perform a specific, single task (e.g., generate analysis, simulate interview, write file). They receive context from the orchestrator and return results in a standardized format.
*   **Explicit State Management (`state.json`, `state.schema.json`):** Workflow state is externalized into a JSON file (`state.json`) whose structure is formally defined by a JSON Schema (`state.schema.json`). The orchestrator reads and writes this file to maintain progress, share data between steps (`shared_data`), and record results/errors (`step_results`, `error_details`).
*   **Defined Interfaces (`INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`):** A formal contract specifies the expected JSON output structure for all Step Prompts (`status`, `output_data`, `summary`, `error_message`). This enables the orchestrator to reliably parse and react to step outputs.
*   **Tool-Based Environment Interaction:** Prompts interact with the external environment (filesystem) via explicitly defined conceptual tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`). The orchestrator relies on these tools for state persistence and step execution relies on them for reading context and writing outputs.
*   **Auxiliary File Convention (`AUXILIARY_FILES.md`):** A standardized structure and naming convention for intermediate and final file outputs generated by steps, ensuring predictability and reliable access by subsequent steps.
*   **Sequential Execution with Placeholders:** The current implementation uses a fixed sequence (`STEP_ORDER`). Looping logic and complex user input are handled via placeholders, acknowledging future requirements but simplifying the MVP execution.
*   **Simulation & Documentation Driven:** The development heavily relied on simulating execution via personas and documenting contracts/structures *before* full implementation, allowing for early validation of the design.

## 3. Key Architectural Qualities

This architecture exhibits several desirable qualities for prompt-based systems:

*   **Modularity:** Separating logic into orchestrator and distinct step prompts makes the system easier to understand, develop, and maintain. Individual steps can potentially be reused or modified independently.
*   **Clarity & Explicitness:** Using contracts, schemas, and detailed instructions within prompts reduces ambiguity compared to relying on the LLM to infer behavior.
*   **Traceability & Debuggability:** Externalized state (`state.json`) and structured step results provide a clear audit trail of the workflow's execution, aiding in debugging failures. Well-defined UX feedback in the orchestrator further helps.
*   **Resilience (Basic):** The orchestrator includes explicit handling for common errors (step failures, invalid JSON, invocation errors), allowing the workflow to halt gracefully and report issues rather than crashing unpredictably.
*   **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns and documentation (contracts, READMEs) improves the ability to manage and update the workflow over time.
*   **Testability:** The modular design and defined interfaces facilitate testing at different levels (unit/step, integration, E2E), as demonstrated by the E2E scenario simulations.

## 4. Converting Insights into QA Benchmarks/Validators

The structure and qualities of the MotM MVP can serve as a benchmark or be adapted into validation workflows for QA of *new* prompt-based workflow projects:

**Benchmark Checklist (for Designing New Workflows):**

Evaluate new workflow designs against these criteria inspired by MotM:

*   **Orchestration:** Is there a clearly defined orchestrator (prompt or code)? Does it handle sequence, state, invocation, parsing, errors?
*   **Modularity:** Is the workflow broken down into logical, single-responsibility steps?
*   **State Management:**
    *   Is state explicitly managed (e.g., in a file)?
    *   Is the state structure clearly defined (e.g., via a schema)?
    *   Is state persisted reliably?
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   Is there a defined communication contract between orchestrator and steps?
    *   Is the contract format robust (e.g., JSON)?
    *   Does it clearly signal success/failure/data?
*   **Environment Interaction:** Are interactions (file I/O, tools) explicitly defined and handled? Are file paths/naming conventions clear?
*   **Error Handling:** Does the design account for step errors, orchestrator errors, tool failures, validation errors? Is error reporting clear?
*   **Documentation:** Are components (orchestrator, steps, contracts, state) adequately documented? Is there a README?
*   **Testability:** Does the design lend itself to unit, integration, and E2E testing? Are acceptance criteria defined?

**Validation Workflow (Conceptual):**

A simplified "QA Validator" workflow could be created to automatically check new workflow artifacts:

1.  **Input:** Paths to the new workflow's artifacts (Orchestrator prompt, step prompts, schema, contract, etc.).
2.  **Step 1: Schema Validation:** Use a JSON schema validator tool (or prompt) to check the new `state.schema.json` for validity and the `state.json` (if an example exists) against the schema.
3.  **Step 2: Contract Check:** Analyze the new `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`. Check if the defined step output structure includes essential fields (like `status`). Check if example outputs conform to the definition.
4.  **Step 3: Step Prompt Analysis:**
    *   Read each `step-*.prompt`.
    *   Verify if it explicitly defines Goal, Input, Output.
    *   Check if its output instructions *claim* to adhere to the `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`.
    *   Check if it mentions necessary tool usage (`read_file`, `edit_file`).
5.  **Step 4: Orchestrator Analysis:**
    *   Read the `Orchestrator.prompt`.
    *   Check for sections explicitly mentioning:
        *   State reading/writing.
        *   Step invocation logic.
        *   Response parsing based on the contract.
        *   Handling of `"success"` and `"error"` statuses.
        *   Error handling for parsing/invocation failures.
6.  **Step 5: Consistency Check:**
    *   Compare `STEP_ORDER` (or equivalent) in the Orchestrator against the available `step-*.prompt` files.
    *   Compare file paths mentioned in prompts/contracts against a defined file structure doc (like `AUXILIARY_FILES.md`).
7.  **Step 6: Report Generation:** Output a QA report summarizing findings, highlighting missing components, inconsistencies, or areas not adhering to the established benchmark patterns derived from MotM.

This validation workflow wouldn't guarantee *functional* correctness but would enforce architectural consistency and adherence to best practices established during the MotM build, significantly improving the quality and maintainability of future prompt-based workflows.
