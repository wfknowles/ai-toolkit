**Feedback**
Thank you all for putting your energy into this concept and providing such a thorough discussion of my concept. My specific feedback is likely rooted in not understanding something, so I apologize for not being more clear initially. Another reason I've abandoned other approaches has to do with copy/paste. I HATE IT. Especially if I'm having to do that more than once per "invocation," I consider the approach a failure. Does our current solution minimize copying and pasting? My interpretation is it's the core. Can we work within this limitation? Is there a way to create a series of different prompt chains that could create the functionality and UX I'm wanting? Can we go back to the drawing board

Step 2: Instruct all experts to please review all *prerequisites* and *feedback* tobecome familiar with it so that they might be prepared for a session where they'll help review the feedback and then refine or refactor the group plan better align with the feedback we've reeceived. Please have them each analyze the feedback and then have them write or diagram out their updated thoughts. Save their initial thoughts within MotM/round-1/feedback/pre-analysis/ named `[persona-name].md`.

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 1

Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs analysis and research any topics you might need to prepare for an interview where you'll work through their updated thoughts, and walk away with enough insight to plan the group phase of this round.

### Phase 4 - Individual Interviews

Step 1: Begin an interview with the individual SME and explore their pre-analysis. They need to be asked a series of questions utilizing your pre-planning:
- Do you see any inherent challenges to the feedback?
- Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?
- If you were to take this feedback and bring it to fruition, how would your solution look like?
- Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?
- Does the current feedback have any blindspots?
- Ask them if they believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific feedback?

Step 2: Save your full interview here MotM/round-1/feedbaack/sme-interviews/ named `[persona name].md`.

### Phase 5 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2

Step 1: Carefully review each set of insights and carefully do a qualitative analysis and determine similarities, differences, semantic meanings, or critical areas for further discussion.

Step 3: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the many different insights and determine major talking points for the experts group analysis in the next step. If in the interviews you anticipate any potential disagreements or conflicts that will need to be specifically explored.

Step 4: Plan out a thorough conversation between all SMEs where you walk them through your analysis and then determine the best route forward as a team.

### Phase 6 - Meeting of the Minds

Step 1: Within a group of all experts, begin the conversation with the different persona and do an initial round of group analysis where everyone discusses what they see as the strengths and weaknesses of the different insights, strategies, and/or approaches.

Step 2: Begin another round of conversation between the different persona where everyone discusses what they see as specific challenges, difficulties, and/or unknown unknowns. Ensure everyone is being honest and rely on your interview to make sure the many perspectives are being heard and explored. It's a group of SMEs and we dont want any idea to be steamrolled.
