### Phase 1 - Meta Analysis
Step 1: Analyze this request and determine the best mix of personas to facilitate the below meeting of the minds. Please adopt those persona.

Step 2: Load the current brain directory.
- Brain Root: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain`
- Today Root: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/04/26`

### Phase 2 - Invitations & Analyzing Prerequisites

Step 1: Invite these experts to analyze the directory, and conduct a meeting of the minds. Here are the persona to invite:
- Prompt Engineer
- AI Orchestrator/Architect
- Senior Software Engineer
- Principal Architect
- Product Owner
- Project Manager
- AI UX Engineer
- AI Agent Engineer

Step 2: We need to prepare this round's subdirectory, so within MotM/round-3/ directory, please create the following subdirectories:
- `pre-analysis`
- `sme-interviews`

Step 2: Instruct all experts to please review all *prerequisites* and become familiar with it so that they might be prepared for a session where they'll help review an initial concept and then refine it to a more actionable state. Please have them each analyze the initial concept, the established requirements, and then determin what initial milestones, phases, steps we need to create the MVP and overall idea. Save their initial thoughts within MotM/round-3/pre-analysis/ named `[persona name].md`.

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 1

Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs analysis and reserach and topics you might need to prepare for an interview where you'll work through their initial thoughts, and walk away with enough insight to plan the group phase of this round.

- Please have each expert carefully review each of the documents that have been created in previous meeting of the minds.
- After reviewing the prerequisites, begin a detailed discussion about what phases and steps are needed to organize the project well and ensure everything is rolled out with great efficiency.
- Discuss potential blindspots that might exist in previous analysis. Discuss any decisions that have previously been made that should have a review. Determine if there are any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might become an issue with scale.

### Phase 4 - Individual Interviews

Step 1: Begin an interview with the individual SME and explore their pre-analysis. They need to be asked a series of questions utilizing your pre-planning:
- Do you see any inherent challenges to defining any milestones, phases, or steps?
- Do you anticipate any areas where there might be friction or hard limits?
- If you were to plan out the project, what would your solution look like?
- Are there any questions that you feel like need to be asked? Or areas where unknown unknowns exist?
- Do you think the previous analysis had any blindspots?
- Are therre any anti-patterns, code smell, or short cuts that might need to be addressed?
- Ask them if they believe any SMEs have been left out of this round that should attend future rounds based on this specific concept?

Step 2: Save your full interview here MotM/round-3/sme-interviews/ named `[persona name].md`.

### Phase 5 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2

Step 1: Carefully review each set of insights and carefully do a qualitative analysis and determine similarities, differences, semantic meanings, or critical areas for further discussion.

Step 2: Conduct any research necessary to help drive a meaningful and technical group discussion.

Step 3: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the many different insights and determine major talking points for the experts group analysis in the next step. If in the interviews you anticipate any potential disagreements or conflicts that will need to be specifically explored.

Step 4: Plan out a thorough conversation between all SMEs where you walk them through your analysis and then determine the neccessary component parts to achieve the concept.


### Phase 6 - Meeting of the Minds

Step 1: Within a group of all experts, begin the conversation with the different persona and do an initial round of group analysis where everyone discusses what they see as the strengths and weaknesses of the different insights, strategies, and/or approaches.

Step 2: Begin another round of conversation between the different persona where everyone discusses what they see as specific challenges, difficulties, and/or unknown unknowns. Ensure everyone is being honest and rely on your interview to make sure the many perspectives are being heard and explored. It's a group of SMEs and we dont want any idea to be steamrolled.

Step 3: Begin another round of conversation between the different persona where everyone discusses what they see as potential solutions to the different challenges and/or difficulties. Discuss strategies for shedding light on any unknowns.
