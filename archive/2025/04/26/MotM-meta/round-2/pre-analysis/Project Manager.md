# Project Manager - R2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** R1 Group Consensus, R1 Analysis Summary.

**Goal:** Define assets, strategies, methodologies for planning and executing the MVP development.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

Translating the R1 consensus into a project plan for the MVP:

1.  **Asset: MVP Project Plan (Outline):**
    *   **Strategy:** Structure the work needed to build the MVP.
    *   **Methodology:** Refine the WBS from R1, focusing on the MVP scope:
        *   **1.0 MVP Definition & Design:**
            *   1.1 Finalize `state.json` Schema.
            *   1.2 Document Fixed Workflow Sequence for MVP.
            *   1.3 Define Step Prompt Interface Contract.
            *   1.4 Draft Orchestrator Prompt Logic.
            *   1.5 Define MVP Acceptance Criteria (from PO).
            *   1.6 Define Testing Strategy (Unit/Integration/E2E concepts).
        *   **2.0 MVP Implementation:**
            *   2.1 Implement Orchestrator Prompt.
            *   2.2 Refactor/Implement Step Prompts for MVP workflow.
            *   2.3 Implement State File Handling (Read/Write logic in prompts).
            *   2.4 Implement UX features (status updates, checkpoints).
        *   **3.0 MVP Testing & Validation:**
            *   3.1 Execute Conceptual Unit/Integration Tests.
            *   3.2 Perform E2E testing within Cursor.
            *   3.3 Validate against Acceptance Criteria.
            *   3.4 Debugging and Refinement.
        *   **4.0 MVP Release & Documentation:**
            *   4.1 Finalize User Documentation.
            *   4.2 Internal Release/Deployment (making the prompt available).

2.  **Strategy: Risk Management Update:**
    *   **Methodology:** Revisit R1 risks in light of MVP scope:
        *   *Technical Feasibility (Mitigated):* Reduced by fixed chain & scope, but *still high* due to prompt/tool reliance.
        *   *Generalization Complexity (Deferred):* Not applicable to MVP.
        *   *Quality Control (Mitigated):* Optional checkpoints help.
        *   *Scope Creep (Mitigated):* Clear MVP definition helps prevent this.
        *   *Tooling Limitations (Accepted):* Still a major constraint.
        *   *NEW RISK:* Effort Estimation Accuracy - Estimating prompt engineering and testing effort is difficult.

3.  **Methodology: Task Breakdown & Estimation (Conceptual):**
    *   **Strategy:** Identify concrete tasks for the implementation phase.
    *   **Methodology:** Break down WBS 2.0 further. E.g., Task 2.2 becomes "Implement Step Prompt: Simulate PE Pre-Analysis", "Implement Step Prompt: Facilitate Group Discussion Step 1", etc. Assign owners (conceptually, PE/AE/SSE). Estimation remains challenging.

4.  **Asset: Definition of Done (DoD) for MVP:**
    *   **Strategy:** Define when the MVP project is considered complete.
    *   **Methodology:** DoD includes:
        *   All MVP features implemented.
        *   Testing completed (defined E2E scenarios pass).
        *   Acceptance criteria met.
        *   User documentation drafted.
        *   Code (prompts) reviewed/refined.

**Key Task:** Translate the agreed-upon MVP design into a structured project plan with clear phases, tasks (as much as possible), defined deliverables (prompts, schema, docs), and acceptance criteria.
