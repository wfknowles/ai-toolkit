# Product Owner - R2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** R1 Group Consensus, R1 Analysis Summary.

**Goal:** Define assets, strategies, methodologies from a product perspective for the MVP.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

Focusing on the value delivery and user experience of the MVP:

1.  **Asset: MVP Feature Definition:**
    *   **Strategy:** Clearly define the user-facing functionality of the MVP.
    *   **Methodology:** The MVP feature is: "Initiate the MotM process for the predefined MVP concept via a single command/prompt. The process runs automatically, providing status updates, until completion or error. Optional checkpoints allow viewing summaries/details. Final outputs (`requirements.md`, `roadmap.md` for the MVP concept) are delivered."
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (High Level):**
        *   User can start the process with one interaction.
        *   No mandatory "Please continue" prompts are required.
        *   Status updates are shown during execution.
        *   Optional checkpoints are presented after R1 analysis and R1 group discussion.
        *   Correct final artifacts (`requirements.md`, `roadmap.md`) are generated for the specific MVP concept upon success.
        *   Errors halt the process and provide clear user notification.

2.  **Asset: User-Facing Documentation (Initial Draft):**
    *   **Strategy:** Explain how to use the new MVP feature.
    *   **Methodology:** Draft simple instructions: "To run the automated MotM MVP workflow, use the command `/motm_mvp`. The process will run in the background. You will see status updates. Optional review points will be offered. On completion, links to the `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md` will be provided."

3.  **Strategy: Value Proposition Confirmation:**
    *   **Methodology:** Reiterate the value: Reduced friction, saved time (compared to manual prompts), demonstration of the chained workflow potential. The value is primarily UX improvement and technical de-risking at this stage.

4.  **Methodology: Defining Checkpoint Content:**
    *   **Strategy:** Specify what summaries should be shown at the optional checkpoints.
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   *Checkpoint 1 (After R1 Analysis):* Summary of key themes/risks identified across all simulated SME pre-analyses. Link to the full `pre-analysis` directory or individual files.
        *   *Checkpoint 2 (After R1 Group Discussion):* Summary of key decisions/outcomes from the simulated group discussion. Link to the full `sme-group-interview.md`.

5.  **Strategy: Success Metrics for MVP:**
    *   **Methodology:** How do we know the MVP is successful?
        *   *Completion Rate:* % of runs completing successfully without error.
        *   *User Feedback (Qualitative):* Does the user perceive the process as smoother/easier?
        *   *Output Correctness:* Do the generated artifacts match expectations for the known MVP concept?

**Key Task:** Ensure the technical assets being defined (prompts, state, orchestrator logic) directly map to delivering the defined MVP feature set and acceptance criteria from the user's perspective.
