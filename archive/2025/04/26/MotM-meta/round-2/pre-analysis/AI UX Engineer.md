# AI UX Engineer - R2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** R1 Group Consensus, R1 Analysis Summary.

**Goal:** Define specific assets and methodologies for the MVP user experience.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

Based on the R1 "glass box" consensus for the MVP:

1.  **Asset: UX Flow Diagram for MVP:**
    *   **Strategy:** Visualize the agreed-upon user journey for the MVP.
    *   **Methodology:** Create a simple flowchart showing: User initiates -> AI confirms & starts -> Status updates appear periodically -> Optional Checkpoint 1 (Summary + Link) -> Optional Checkpoint 2 (Summary + Link) -> AI delivers final artifacts -> End. Include the error path: Step fails -> AI reports error -> Halt.

2.  **Asset: Status Update Message Templates:**
    *   **Strategy:** Define the exact wording for progress indication.
    *   **Methodology:** Create templates like: "*Status: Running step [Step Name]...*", "*Status: Step [Step Name] complete.*" Keep them concise and consistent.

3.  **Asset: Optional Checkpoint Message Templates & Interaction Model:**
    *   **Strategy:** Define the user interaction at checkpoints.
    *   **Methodology:** Template: "Phase [Phase Name] complete. Key findings: [1-2 sentence summary]. [View full details](/path/to/artifact.md)? You can reply 'continue' to proceed automatically, or provide feedback now."
        *   Define logic: If user replies 'continue' or provides no input within X time (if timeout is feasible, unlikely in chat), Orchestrator proceeds. If user provides feedback, how is it captured/used? *Recommendation for MVP: Checkpoints are view-only plus 'continue'. Incorporating feedback mid-chain adds too much complexity. Feedback can be gathered after the run.*)

4.  **Asset: Error Message Templates:**
    *   **Strategy:** Ensure errors are reported clearly and non-technically.
    *   **Methodology:** Template: "Sorry, the process encountered an error during the '[Step Name]' step. [Brief, simple explanation, e.g., 'Could not process intermediate data']. The process has stopped. You can find the current state in `state.json`."

5.  **Methodology: Usability Heuristics Check:**
    *   **Strategy:** Briefly evaluate the proposed MVP flow against standard usability principles.
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   *Visibility of System Status:* Addressed by status updates & checkpoints.
        *   *User Control and Freedom:* Addressed by optional checkpoints (to pause/review) and clear error exits.
        *   *Consistency and Standards:* Addressed by using templates for messages.
        *   *Error Prevention:* Partially addressed by fixed chain, but inherent risks remain.
        *   *Help and Documentation:* Addressed by simple user docs (PO).

**Key Task:** Detailing the exact user-facing messages (status, checkpoints, errors) and defining the precise interaction model for the optional checkpoints within the MVP scope.
