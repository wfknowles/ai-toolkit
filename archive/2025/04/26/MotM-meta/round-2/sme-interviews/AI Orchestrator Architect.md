# Interview R2: AI Orchestrator/Architect

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** AI Orchestrator/Architect (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for detailing the orchestration logic, state management specifics, and testing strategy. You recommended storing large blobs as separate files with paths in `state.json`. Any challenges in defining or managing these auxiliary files?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** The main challenge is ensuring uniqueness and predictability of filenames, especially if multiple runs occur. Using the `workflow_id` and `step_name` in the filename (e.g., `<workflow_id>-step-<step_name>-output.md`) helps. Also, the Step Prompts need clear instructions on *constructing* these filenames and the Orchestrator needs logic to *pass* the correct filenames between steps via `state.json`. There's also no automatic cleanup; these files will accumulate unless we add a manual cleanup step or process later.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned defining the exact sequence for the fixed chain. Do you see friction in mapping the existing multi-round monolithic prompts to a clean linear sequence?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** There might be some friction. The monoliths might have implicit loops or dependencies within a single prompt run. Mapping that perfectly to discrete, linear steps might require some interpretation or slight simplification of the original logic. We need to document the chosen sequence very clearly (as the PA suggested).

**Facilitator:** What's your ideal approach for defining the `state.json` schema and the Step Interface contract?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** My ideal solution is:
1.  A formal `state.schema.json` file using JSON Schema standards. This allows for potential programmatic validation if tools ever become available, and serves as unambiguous documentation.
2.  A separate `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` document that clearly defines, for *each* step in the fixed chain:
    *   Input keys expected from `state.json`.
    *   Output keys the step *must* place within the `output_data` block of its response JSON.
    *   Any auxiliary files read or written (and their naming convention).
This documentation is crucial for the prompt engineers implementing the steps.

**Facilitator:** What technical unknowns are most pressing for you now?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:**
*   The actual performance overhead of the read-update-write cycle for `state.json` on *each* step. Will this make the chain feel too slow?
*   How reliably can the Orchestrator prompt instruct the `edit_file` tool to *overwrite* the entire `state.json` file correctly, especially if the state grows large (though using paths for blobs mitigates this)?
*   The practical feasibility of the conceptual testing strategy â€“ can we effectively mock step responses or simulate failures for testing the orchestrator within chat?

**Facilitator:** Any R1 blindspots from an architectural view?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** Perhaps we didn't sufficiently emphasize the need for *versioning* the `state.json` schema and potentially the prompts themselves. As this evolves (even post-MVP), managing compatibility between different versions of the orchestrator, step prompts, and state schema will be critical but hard to enforce in this environment.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for this round?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** No, this team composition is still appropriate for defining the MVP build details.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. The points on auxiliary file management and versioning are important.
