# Interview R2: Prompt Engineer

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Prompt Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for outlining the key prompt assets for the MVP. You focused on the Orchestrator, Step Prompts, State Schema, and UX Prompts. Any inherent challenges you foresee in *defining* or *implementing* these prompt assets within the Cursor environment?

**Prompt Engineer:** The main challenge in definition is the required *precision*. For the Orchestrator to work, the Step Prompts *must* adhere perfectly to the input expectations and output JSON format. Even minor deviations in LLM responses could break the chain. Defining prompts that guarantee this level of consistency from the LLM is difficult. For implementation, the challenge is refactoring the existing monolithic logic â€“ it might not map cleanly to discrete steps, requiring some logic redesign.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned the Orchestrator needs to parse the JSON response. Do you anticipate friction or hard limits in the LLM's ability to reliably extract and validate this JSON from a potentially longer chat response?

**Prompt Engineer:** Yes, that's a significant friction point. LLMs aren't perfect parsers. Instructing it to *only* output the JSON is ideal but not always followed. The Orchestrator prompt needs robust instructions to locate the JSON block (e.g., using ```json ... ``` fences) and handle cases where it's missing, malformed, or the `status` key isn't 'success'. The hard limit is the LLM's consistency in following these parsing and validation instructions.

**Facilitator:** If you were writing the Step Prompts, what would your ideal solution look like to ensure they conform to the required output format?

**Prompt Engineer:** My ideal solution involves:
1.  **Strict Output Templating:** Within the prompt's instructions, provide the *exact* JSON structure expected, using placeholders. E.g., `Output ONLY the following JSON structure: { "status": "<success_or_error>", "output_data": { "result_key": "<your_result_here>" } }`.
2.  **Few-Shot Examples:** Include 1-2 examples within the prompt showing the correct output format for a hypothetical task.
3.  **Simplicity:** Keep the `output_data` structure as simple as possible for each step. Avoid deeply nested objects if possible.
4.  **Validation Instructions:** Explicitly tell the LLM to validate its own output against the requested format before responding, although this has limited effectiveness.

**Facilitator:** What unknowns still need clarification before implementing these prompts?

**Prompt Engineer:**
*   The exact mapping of the original MotM workflow into discrete, fixed steps.
*   The final agreed-upon `state.json` schema, including how auxiliary file paths will be handled.
*   How effective are few-shot examples vs. strict templating in ensuring consistent JSON output from *this specific* LLM in Cursor?

**Facilitator:** Looking back at the Round 1 analysis, were there any blindspots regarding the prompt engineering aspects that we should address now?

**Prompt Engineer:** I think we adequately covered the risks in R1. The main thing is not underestimating the iterative effort required to get prompts working reliably, especially the Orchestrator's parsing/validation logic and the Step Prompts' output consistency. It won't likely work perfectly on the first try.

**Facilitator:** And for this round of defining assets and methodologies, any missing SMEs?

**Prompt Engineer:** No, the current group (including the Principal Architect) covers the necessary perspectives for defining *how* to build the MVP prompts and structure.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. That clarifies the prompt implementation challenges.
