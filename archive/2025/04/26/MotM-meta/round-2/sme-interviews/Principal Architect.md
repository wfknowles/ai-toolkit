# Interview R2: Principal Architect

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Principal Architect (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Welcome, and thanks for your R2 analysis focusing on the broader design documentation and maintainability. You proposed documenting the MVP workflow sequence explicitly. Any challenges in defining that sequence accurately based on the original monoliths?

**Principal Architect:** The primary challenge, as the Architect noted, is translating potentially complex or interwoven logic within the monoliths into a strictly linear sequence. It requires careful analysis of the original prompts to extract the essential flow. There might be a need for judgment calls on simplifying or reordering minor operations to fit the linear model. The key is that the *documented* sequence must be the one the Orchestrator *actually* implements.

**Facilitator:** You emphasized designing for maintainability and future-proofing even in the MVP. What specific strategies beyond modular prompts and clear schema do you recommend?

**Principal Architect:** 
1.  **Configuration in State:** Store any potentially configurable parameters (even if fixed for MVP) in `state.json` rather than hardcoding in prompts. E.g., if a step involves simulating N experts, N should be in the state.
2.  **Clear Naming Conventions:** For prompts, state keys, auxiliary files – make them descriptive and consistent.
3.  **Prompt Versioning (Conceptual):** Ideally, prompts would have version numbers, and the state file could record which version of each prompt was used. This is hard to enforce here but good practice to consider mentally.
4.  **Comprehensive Documentation:** The conceptual "Technical Design Document" asset is crucial. It centralizes all decisions (schema, sequence, interfaces, etc.) making onboarding or future modifications much easier.

**Facilitator:** What's your ideal solution for creating and maintaining this Technical Design Document?

**Principal Architect:** It should be a living document, likely a well-structured Markdown file (`TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`) stored alongside the prompts. It should be updated *as* decisions are made or changed. Key sections would include Overview, Architecture, State Schema (`state.schema.json` could be embedded or linked), Workflow Sequence (diagram + list), Step Interface Contracts, and Known Limitations. Ownership could rotate or fall to the Architect/PA.

**Facilitator:** What unknowns regarding the overall architecture or its long-term viability concern you most?

**Principal Architect:**
*   The *true* cost of maintainability. How difficult will it *actually* be to debug a failure mid-chain by examining prompts and state files?
*   Scalability limits: If we try to add many more steps post-MVP, will the orchestration or state management approach break down due to complexity or performance?
*   The risk of this prompt-based system becoming "write-only" – easy to build initially but very hard to modify safely later.

**Facilitator:** Looking back at R1, any architectural blindspots?

**Principal Architect:** Similar to the Architect's point on versioning, perhaps we didn't sufficiently discuss the *lifecycle* of the workflow. How are runs initiated? How are old state/auxiliary files cleaned up? How is the system updated if prompts need refinement? These operational aspects were less explored.

**Facilitator:** For defining these architectural assets and strategies, any missing SMEs?

**Principal Architect:** No, the addition of the PA role helps cover the broader design and documentation aspects. The team is well-rounded for this phase.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. Your focus on documentation and maintainability is vital.
