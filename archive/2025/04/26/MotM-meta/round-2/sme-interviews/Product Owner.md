# Interview R2: Product Owner

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Product Owner (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for defining the MVP feature set, acceptance criteria, and checkpoint content. You defined the MVP feature tightly around replicating the existing workflow's *outcome* with better UX. Are there any challenges in ensuring the *quality* of the final `requirements.md` / `roadmap.md` remains high with the new automated process?

**Product Owner:** The main challenge is ensuring the simulated analysis and synthesis within the automated steps are as deep and insightful as potentially occurred with the more interactive monolithic prompts. The optional checkpoints help us validate direction, but the core generation happens within the step prompts. We rely on the prompt engineering (PE/AE) to make those steps effective. The acceptance criteria must include validating the *content* and *quality* of the final artifacts, not just their successful generation.

**Facilitator:** Regarding the checkpoints, the UX Engineer suggested making them view-only plus 'continue' for the MVP to avoid mid-chain feedback complexity. Does that align with your product needs for the MVP?

**Product Owner:** Yes, for the MVP, that's an acceptable tradeoff. Let's prove the automated flow first. Capturing feedback *after* the run (based on the final output and potentially the intermediate artifacts linked at checkpoints) is sufficient for iterating on the MVP. Trying to inject feedback mid-stream sounds technically very complex based on the R1 discussion.

**Facilitator:** What's your ideal way to define and track the MVP acceptance criteria?

**Product Owner:** The high-level criteria I outlined should be formalized, perhaps in the PA's proposed `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` or a separate `MVP_ACCEPTANCE.md`. For tracking during testing, we'd need specific test cases:
*   Run `/motm_mvp` -> Verify no user prompts needed.
*   Verify status updates appear.
*   Verify Checkpoint 1 message/link appears -> Click link (manual check) -> Verify content -> Enter 'continue' -> Verify process proceeds.
*   Verify Checkpoint 2 message/link appears -> ... -> Verify process proceeds.
*   Verify successful completion message and links to artifacts.
*   Verify content of final `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md` matches expected output for the known MVP concept.
*   Induce an error -> Verify correct error message and halt.

**Facilitator:** What product-related unknowns are top of mind now?

**Product Owner:**
*   Will the MVP, even if smoother, actually *feel* faster to the user, given the potential backend latency?
*   How clear do the checkpoint summaries need to be for users to feel informed without needing to click the details link every time?
*   Will users understand this is an MVP replicating *one specific* workflow, or will they expect the generalization immediately?

**Facilitator:** Any R1 blindspots from a product perspective?

**Product Owner:** Maybe we didn't fully explore alternative UX paradigms *besides* chaining. Given the technical risks of chaining, were there other ways to reduce friction in the monoliths (e.g., better background processing, clearer prompts) that we dismissed too quickly? It's likely academic now that we've chosen the MVP path, but perhaps a minor blindspot.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for this round?

**Product Owner:** No, the team covers the definition phase well. We'll need actual users for feedback on the completed MVP.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. Defining those acceptance criteria clearly will be key.
