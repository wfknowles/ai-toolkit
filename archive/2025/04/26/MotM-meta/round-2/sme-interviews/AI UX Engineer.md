# Interview R2: AI UX Engineer

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** AI UX Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for detailing the MVP UX assets like the flow, templates, and interaction model. You recommended checkpoints be 'view-only + continue' for MVP. Any challenges in defining the *summary* content for those checkpoints effectively?

**AI UX Engineer:** The challenge is making the summary concise yet meaningful. It needs to give the user confidence in the process's direction without requiring them to parse jargon or excessive detail. For Checkpoint 1 (after R1 analysis), summarizing the top 2-3 themes or risks identified seems right. For Checkpoint 2 (after R1 group discussion), summarizing the key decisions or the proposed path forward. Crafting these summary-generation instructions for the relevant Step Prompt will require careful prompt engineering.

**Facilitator:** How should the system ideally handle the 'continue' part? Does the user explicitly type 'continue', or should the Orchestrator just proceed after showing the checkpoint message?

**AI UX Engineer:** Explicitly asking the user to type 'continue' (or click a button if the interface supported it) provides a clearer sense of control, even if it adds a tiny bit of friction back. It confirms the user acknowledged the checkpoint. Simply proceeding automatically might feel *too* fast or like the checkpoint was just noise. So, my ideal for MVP: Show message -> Wait for 'continue' reply -> Proceed.

**Facilitator:** Regarding error messages, you emphasized clarity. What's your ideal methodology for ensuring messages are user-friendly when the underlying error might be technical (e.g., JSON parsing failed)?

**AI UX Engineer:** We need a mapping or translation layer. The technical error detected by the Orchestrator (e.g., `StateParseError`, `StepTimeoutError`, `ToolApiError`) should be mapped to a pre-defined, user-friendly message. The template should include *what* failed (step name), a *simple* possible reason (without technical details), and *what happens now* (process stopped, check state file). Avoid exposing stack traces or internal error codes to the user.

**Facilitator:** What UX-related unknowns are most important to resolve now?

**AI UX Engineer:**
*   What's the right *tone* for the AI assistant during this automated process? Should it be purely functional, or slightly more conversational/guided?
*   How long should the process realistically take? If it's many minutes, user perception of the UX will be poor, even without interruptions. Performance matters.
*   Will the simple status updates be sufficient, or will users need a more granular progress indicator (which is likely impossible in chat)?

**Facilitator:** Reflecting on R1, any UX blindspots missed?

**AI UX Engineer:** My previous point about the potential *value* of cognitive pauses still stands as something we perhaps under-discussed in R1. Are we optimizing for interaction efficiency at the expense of the user's thinking process during complex ideation? It's a subtle but important UX consideration for the overall MotM concept, even if the MVP just replicates the existing flow faster.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for defining these UX assets?

**AI UX Engineer:** No, the current team can define these UX templates and flows.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. The details on checkpoint interaction and error message mapping are valuable.
