# Interview R2: AI Agent Engineer

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** AI Agent Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for detailing the Step Prompt template and the Orchestrator's processing logic. You mentioned the need for Step Prompts to construct unique paths for auxiliary files. Any challenges in defining that logic within the prompt?

**AI Agent Engineer:** The main challenge is ensuring consistency. The prompt needs to instruct the LLM to reliably combine elements like a base path (from `state.json`), the `workflow_id` (from `state.json`), the current `step_name` (which needs to be passed to it), and a standard suffix (e.g., `-output.md`) to form the path. It also needs to correctly place this generated path into the `output_data` JSON block. It requires precise instructions.

**Facilitator:** How would you ideally define the Orchestrator's logic for parsing and validating the JSON response from a Step Prompt?

**AI Agent Engineer:** The ideal Orchestrator prompt instructions would be:
1.  "Scan the Step Prompt's response for a JSON code block ```json ... ```."
2.  "If found, attempt to parse the content as JSON."
3.  "If parsing succeeds, check if a 'status' key exists."
4.  "If 'status' is 'success', extract the 'output_data' object. Proceed to state update."
5.  "If 'status' is not 'success' (or any other value), treat as error. Extract any message from 'output_data' if available."
6.  "If parsing fails or JSON block/status key not found, treat as error."
7.  "On any error, set `state.status` to 'error', add details to `state.error_message`, and halt."
This explicit logic flow is needed within the Orchestrator's meta-prompt.

**Facilitator:** What's your preferred approach for the Step Prompt template (`step-prompt-template.md`) asset itself?

**AI Agent Engineer:** A physical template file (`step-prompt-template.md`) in the repository is ideal. It serves as documentation and a starting point for implementing each new Step Prompt. It should contain all the standard sections (`## Role`, `## Input`, `## Task`, `## Tool Usage`, `## Output Format`) with clear explanations and placeholders.

**Facilitator:** What unknowns remain regarding the pseudo-agent implementation?

**AI Agent Engineer:**
*   The LLM's actual token limits when combining Orchestrator logic + injected state data + Step Prompt template + step-specific instructions. Will complex steps exceed the context window?
*   How gracefully does the LLM handle file I/O errors reported by the tools? Does it follow instructions to set the status to 'error', or does it just stop?
*   The level of prompt engineering detail needed to make the JSON parsing/validation logic work *reliably* in the Orchestrator across many runs.

**Facilitator:** Any R1 blindspots related to the agent engineering aspect?

**AI Agent Engineer:** Maybe we underestimated the complexity of the Orchestrator's *prompt*. It's doing a lot: state parsing, logic flow, step invocation, response parsing, response validation, state update generation, file writing instructions. Making one prompt manage all that reliably is a significant engineering challenge in itself.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for defining these agent/orchestrator assets?

**AI Agent Engineer:** No, I think the PE, Arch, SSE, and myself cover the necessary technical details for defining how these prompts and interactions should work.

**Facilitator:** Understood. Thank you for the detailed logic for the orchestrator and agent interactions.
