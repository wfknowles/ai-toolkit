# Interview R2: Project Manager

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Project Manager (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for refining the MVP project plan and WBS. You highlighted effort estimation for prompt engineering as a new risk. Any strategies for defining or managing the implementation tasks (WBS 2.0)?

**Project Manager:** Defining the tasks involves breaking down the MVP workflow sequence (from PA/Arch) into individual Step Prompt implementations. E.g., "Implement Step Prompt S1", "Implement Step Prompt S2", etc. Plus tasks for the Orchestrator logic and UX elements. Managing them requires clear ownership (assigning PE/AE/SSE to prompt tasks) and frequent check-ins. Since estimation is hard, we might need to timebox efforts initially and adjust the plan based on actual progress during the implementation phase (WBS 2.0/3.0).

**Facilitator:** The Definition of Done relies on testing. Given the constraints, how do you see the conceptual Testing Strategy (Unit/Integration/E2E) being practically executed?

**Project Manager:** It will be challenging and likely quite manual.
*   *Unit Testing (Prompts):* The assigned owner (PE/AE/SSE) manually runs their specific Step Prompt in Cursor with crafted input data (simulating state) and verifies the output JSON format/content.
*   *Integration Testing (Orchestrator Logic):* Could involve manually crafting state files representing different stages, running the Orchestrator prompt, and checking if it correctly identifies the next step, formats the *next* prompt (without actually running it fully), or correctly handles a simulated error state.
*   *E2E Testing:* Manually run the full `/motm_mvp` command in Cursor. Observe the status updates, interact with checkpoints, check `state.json` periodically, verify auxiliary files are created, and validate the final output artifacts against the PO's acceptance criteria. This will be the most crucial but time-consuming part.

**Facilitator:** What's your ideal solution for tracking progress against the plan and DoD?

**Project Manager:** Given the environment, simple is best. Maintain the WBS/Task list in a shared document (maybe the `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` or a separate `PROJECT_PLAN.md`). Update task statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done) manually during check-ins. Track completion of DoD items as testing progresses. We don't have sophisticated project tracking tools here.

**Facilitator:** What project management unknowns worry you most now?

**Project Manager:**
*   The *actual* time required for the iterative debug/refine cycle (WBS 3.4) when prompts inevitably don't work as expected.
*   Ensuring consistent quality and adherence to standards across prompts developed by different people (PE/AE/SSE).
*   The risk of hitting unexpected tool limitations (e.g., `edit_file` rate limits, file size issues) during implementation or testing.

**Facilitator:** Looking back at R1, any project management blindspots?

**Project Manager:** We perhaps didn't explicitly allocate time for *documentation* (writing the schema def, interface contracts, user docs) within the WBS. It was implied, but should be a distinct task/deliverable set.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for this definition phase?

**Project Manager:** No, the team is sufficient for defining the plan and assets.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. The focus on practical testing and tracking is helpful.
