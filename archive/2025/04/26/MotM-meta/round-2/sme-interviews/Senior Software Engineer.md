# Interview R2: Senior Software Engineer

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Senior Software Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for focusing on the implementation details, particularly state/auxiliary file handling and robust `edit_file` usage. You suggested overwriting `state.json` entirely on each update. Any challenges defining the prompt logic to reliably generate the *full* updated JSON?

**Senior Software Engineer:** The challenge is ensuring the LLM correctly incorporates the *new* data from the step's output into the *existing* state structure without dropping/corrupting other keys. The prompt needs to be very explicit: "1. Here is the current state JSON [pass current JSON]. 2. Here is the output data from the step [pass output data]. 3. Generate the *complete* JSON object representing the new state by updating key X with the output data and incrementing key Y, ensuring all other keys remain unchanged." It adds complexity to the Orchestrator's prompt generation step.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned needing precise `edit_file` instructions. What friction points do you see there?

**Senior Software Engineer:** The main friction is the lack of guarantees. We're instructing a text-based tool via an LLM. Can we be *certain* it targets the right file path (`state.json`) every time? Can we ensure it correctly performs the overwrite? What if the generated JSON is huge â€“ are there size limits for the `code_edit` parameter? These rely on the tool's robustness, which is somewhat unknown.

**Facilitator:** What's your ideal solution for the Step Prompt implementation, focusing on making them robust and easy for the Orchestrator to handle?

**Senior Software Engineer:** My ideal builds on others' points:
1.  **Standard Template:** Use the AE's proposed template (`## Role`, `## Input`, `## Task`, `## Tool Usage`, `## Output Format`).
2.  **Explicit JSON Output:** Mandate the `{ "status": ..., "output_data": ... }` block in the response, keeping `output_data` as flat as possible.
3.  **Self-Contained Logic:** Each step should perform its task based *only* on the inputs provided by the Orchestrator (from `state.json` or specified auxiliary files). Avoid implicit dependencies on previous steps' internal workings.
4.  **Clear Auxiliary File I/O:** Instructions must be precise about *reading* from specified paths (provided by Orchestrator) and *writing* to new, unique paths (constructed using workflow/step ID), then returning those *new paths* in `output_data`.

**Facilitator:** What unknowns remain from an implementation perspective?

**Senior Software Engineer:**
*   The actual latency added by reading state, potentially reading auxiliary files, writing auxiliary files (if any), and writing state *for every single step*. Could be significant.
*   How does the `edit_file` tool handle concurrent write attempts if something went wrong with the prompt logic? (Likely not an issue in serial chat, but conceptually concerning).
*   The LLM's practical limit for generating large, correctly structured JSON blobs for the `state.json` overwrite.

**Facilitator:** Looking back at R1, any engineering blindspots we missed?

**Senior Software Engineer:** We focused heavily on state *persistence* but maybe not enough on state *size* and *performance*. The strategy of using paths in JSON for large blobs helps, but the cumulative effect of many steps reading/writing even small state updates needs consideration regarding overall execution time.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for defining these implementation assets?

**Senior Software Engineer:** No, the team seems well-equipped to define these low-level implementation details.

**Facilitator:** Thanks for the focus on implementation robustness.
