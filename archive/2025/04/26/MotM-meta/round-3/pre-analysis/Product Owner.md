# Product Owner - R3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** R2 Group Consensus, R2 Analysis Summary, MVP Requirements.

**Goal:** Define initial milestones, phases, steps for MVP delivery from a product value perspective.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

Aligning the implementation plan with delivering user value and meeting acceptance criteria.

**Phase 1: Design & Definition Validation (Milestone: MVP Requirements Finalized)**
*   **Step 1.1:** Review and confirm final `MVP_WORKFLOW.md` sequence accurately reflects the desired MVP process flow.
*   **Step 1.2:** Review and confirm `MVP_ACCEPTANCE.md` captures all necessary functional and UX criteria.
*   **Step 1.3:** Review UX message templates for clarity and tone.
*   **Step 1.4:** Ensure technical design (`TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`) aligns with product requirements.

**Phase 2: Implementation Sprints/Cycles (Milestone: Key Features Demonstrable)**
*   **Step 2.1:** Prioritize implementation tasks (PM/Tech Lead) focusing on end-to-end flow first.
*   **Step 2.2:** Regular demos/check-ins to see progress on the core chain execution.
*   **Step 2.3:** Focus early testing on the core success path of the workflow.

**Phase 3: UX Feature Implementation & Testing (Milestone: MVP UX Complete)**
*   **Step 3.1:** Implement and test status updates.
*   **Step 3.2:** Implement and test checkpoint interactions (summary display, links, 'continue' prompt).
*   **Step 3.3:** Implement and test error message display.
*   **Step 3.4:** Validate overall flow against UX requirements (REQ-UX-*).

**Phase 4: Acceptance Testing & Release (Milestone: MVP Accepted)**
*   **Step 4.1:** Execute acceptance tests based on `MVP_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
*   **Step 4.2:** Validate correctness and quality of final `requirements.md`/`roadmap.md` outputs for the MVP concept.
*   **Step 4.3:** Review user documentation for clarity.
*   **Step 4.4:** Sign off on MVP completion.

**Potential Blindspots/Anti-Patterns:**
*   **Focusing only on technical completion:** Not adequately testing the *quality* of the final generated artifacts.
*   **Poor UX implementation:** Implementing status updates or checkpoints in a way that is still confusing or disruptive despite the design.
*   **Misaligned priorities:** Technical team focusing on complex edge cases before the core success path is stable and delivers value.

**Key Consideration:** Continuous validation against the acceptance criteria throughout the implementation and testing phases is critical to ensure the MVP delivers the intended product value (improved UX, correct output for the defined scope).
