# AI UX Engineer - R3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** R2 Group Consensus, R2 Analysis Summary, MVP Requirements.

**Goal:** Define initial milestones, phases, steps for implementing and testing the MVP user experience.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

Focusing on the UX aspects of the MVP build and validation.

**Phase 1: Asset Finalization (Milestone: UX Assets Ready for Implementation)**
*   **Step 1.1:** Finalize UX Flow Diagram for MVP.
*   **Step 1.2:** Finalize templates for Status Updates, Checkpoint Messages (including summary content guidelines), and Error Messages.
*   **Step 1.3:** Define the exact interaction model for checkpoints (User must type 'continue').
*   **Step 1.4:** Review final plan/acceptance criteria to ensure UX needs are covered.

**Phase 2: Implementation Support (Milestone: UX Features Implemented)**
*   **Step 2.1:** Provide finalized templates and flow diagram to PE/AE implementing Orchestrator logic.
*   **Step 2.2:** Be available to clarify UX requirements during implementation.
*   **Step 2.3:** Review initial implementations of status updates, checkpoints, and error messages as they become available (e.g., during demos).

**Phase 3: UX Testing & Refinement (Milestone: MVP Meets UX Acceptance Criteria)**
*   **Step 3.1:** Participate in E2E testing, specifically focusing on the user journey, clarity of messages, and interaction flow.
*   **Step 3.2:** Validate against REQ-UX-* requirements and PO's acceptance criteria related to UX.
*   **Step 3.3:** Identify usability issues (e.g., confusing messages, awkward timing of updates/checkpoints, perceived slowness).
*   **Step 3.4:** Work with PE/AE/SSE to refine prompts (Orchestrator or Step Prompts generating summaries) or message timing based on testing feedback.
*   **Step 3.5:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the 'view-only + continue' checkpoint model in practice.

**Phase 4: Documentation Review (Milestone: User Docs Accurate)**
*   **Step 4.1:** Review final user documentation (from PO) for clarity, accuracy, and alignment with the final UX.

**Potential Blindspots/Anti-Patterns:**
*   **Inconsistent Tone:** Status updates, checkpoints, and error messages having different tones, feeling disjointed.
*   **Information Overload:** Checkpoint summaries being too verbose, defeating the purpose.
*   **Ignoring Performance:** Not considering how technical latency impacts the perceived user experience, even if interactions are automated.
*   **Testing Only Happy Path:** Not sufficiently testing the UX of error conditions or less common interaction paths.

**Key Consideration:** The iterative nature of testing and refinement (Phase 3) is vital for UX. The initial message templates and flow might need adjustments based on how the system actually behaves and feels during E2E testing.
