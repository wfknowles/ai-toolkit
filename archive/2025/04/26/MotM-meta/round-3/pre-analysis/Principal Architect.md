# Principal Architect - R3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** R2 Group Consensus, R2 Analysis Summary, MVP Requirements.

**Goal:** Define initial milestones, phases, steps for MVP implementation, focusing on architectural consistency and future readiness.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

Structuring the MVP implementation project with an eye towards the defined architecture and potential future evolution.

**Phase 1: Design Finalization & Documentation (Milestone: Implementation Blueprint Ready)**
*   **Step 1.1:** Create & Finalize `MVP_WORKFLOW.md` (Document the step sequence).
*   **Step 1.2:** Create & Finalize `state.schema.json`.
*   **Step 1.3:** Create & Finalize `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` (Define I/O for each step in the sequence).
*   **Step 1.4:** Create & Populate `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` (Consolidate all design decisions).
*   **Step 1.5:** Review & Approve all design documents with the team.

**Phase 2: Core Framework Implementation (Milestone: Orchestrator & Basic Chain Operational)**
*   **Step 2.1:** Implement core Orchestrator logic (state read/write, basic sequencing, validation stubs).
*   **Step 2.2:** Implement basic Step Prompt template file.
*   **Step 2.3:** Implement 1-2 simple Step Prompts conforming to the contract.
*   **Step 2.4:** Test the basic chain operation: Orchestrator invokes simple steps, state persists.

**Phase 3: MVP Workflow Implementation (Milestone: Full MVP Step Logic Implemented)**
*   **Step 3.1:** Implement remaining Step Prompts based on `MVP_WORKFLOW.md`, adhering strictly to `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`.
*   **Step 3.2:** Ensure modularity and include comments in prompts.
*   **Step 3.3:** Perform conceptual unit tests for each Step Prompt.

**Phase 4: Integration, Testing & Refinement (Milestone: MVP Functionally Complete & Stable)**
*   **Step 4.1:** Integrate all components (Orchestrator, Steps, UX Prompts).
*   **Step 4.2:** Implement full Orchestrator validation and error handling logic.
*   **Step 4.3:** Implement checkpoint logic.
*   **Step 4.4:** Execute E2E testing plan.
*   **Step 4.5:** Debug and iterate based on testing.
*   **Step 4.6:** Architectural Review: Check final implementation against design docs for consistency and maintainability.

**Phase 5: Release Preparation (Milestone: MVP Ready for Use)**
*   **Step 5.1:** Final prompt reviews.
*   **Step 5.2:** Final validation against acceptance criteria.
*   **Step 5.3:** Finalize user documentation.

**Potential Blindspots/Anti-Patterns:**
*   **Documentation Drift:** Failing to keep `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` and other docs updated as implementation details inevitably evolve during debugging.
*   **Violating Modularity:** Creating implicit dependencies between Step Prompts, bypassing the Orchestrator or interface contract.
*   **Inconsistent Implementation:** Different engineers implementing prompts with slightly different interpretations of the standards or varying quality.
*   **Technical Debt (Prompt Debt):** Taking shortcuts in prompt logic or error handling for expediency, making future changes harder.

**Key Consideration:** Emphasize the importance of adhering to the defined interfaces and documentation throughout the implementation phases to manage complexity and maintain architectural integrity.
