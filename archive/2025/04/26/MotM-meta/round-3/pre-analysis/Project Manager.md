# Project Manager - R3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** R2 Group Consensus, R2 Analysis Summary, MVP Requirements.

**Goal:** Define initial milestones, phases, steps for managing the MVP project execution.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

Structuring the project execution based on the defined assets and requirements from R2.

**Phase 1: Planning & Kickoff (Milestone: Project Ready to Start)**
*   **Step 1.1:** Finalize and review detailed WBS / Task List based on R2/R3 pre-analyses.
*   **Step 1.2:** Assign owners to specific implementation tasks (Orchestrator, Step Prompts, UX elements, Documentation).
*   **Step 1.3:** Confirm timeline estimates (or timeboxes) for phases/milestones.
*   **Step 1.4:** Establish check-in cadence (e.g., daily standups, weekly demos).
*   **Step 1.5:** Ensure all prerequisite documentation (Schema, Workflow, Interface, Acceptance Criteria) is complete and accessible.
*   **Step 1.6:** Project Kickoff meeting.

**Phase 2: Implementation & Tracking (Milestone: All Components Built & Unit Tested)**
*   **Step 2.1:** Monitor task progress against the plan (using `PROJECT_PLAN.md` or similar).
*   **Step 2.2:** Facilitate regular check-ins and address blockers.
*   **Step 2.3:** Track completion of conceptual "unit tests" for prompts.
*   **Step 2.4:** Manage any scope changes or requirement clarifications.

**Phase 3: Integration, Testing & Reporting (Milestone: MVP Functionally Complete)**
*   **Step 3.1:** Coordinate integration efforts.
*   **Step 3.2:** Oversee execution of the E2E testing plan.
*   **Step 3.3:** Track bugs/issues identified during testing.
*   **Step 3.4:** Report progress and risks to stakeholders.
*   **Step 3.5:** Ensure debugging and refinement cycles are managed effectively.

**Phase 4: Validation & Release (Milestone: MVP Delivered)**
*   **Step 4.1:** Coordinate final acceptance testing with PO.
*   **Step 4.2:** Ensure Definition of Done (DoD) is met.
*   **Step 4.3:** Manage the internal release/handover process.
*   **Step 4.4:** Project close-out: lessons learned, final report.

**Potential Blindspots/Anti-Patterns:**
*   **Lack of Clear Ownership:** Ambiguity over who implements or fixes specific prompts/logic.
*   **Poor Communication:** Development team members not communicating blockers or deviations from the plan.
*   **Insufficient Tracking:** Not keeping the WBS/task list up-to-date, losing visibility of actual progress.
*   **Scope Creep during Debugging:** Allowing bug fixes to balloon into unplanned feature changes.

**Key Consideration:** Given the uncertainties in prompt engineering effort, maintaining flexibility in the plan (especially during testing/debugging phases) and ensuring clear, frequent communication among the team will be crucial for success.
