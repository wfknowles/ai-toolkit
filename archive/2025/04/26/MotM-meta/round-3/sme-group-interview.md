# Meeting of the Minds: Meta-Workflow MVP Implementation Plan (Round 3)

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Attendees:** Prompt Engineer (PE), AI Orchestrator/Architect (Arch), Senior Software Engineer (SSE), Principal Architect (PA), Product Owner (PO), Project Manager (PM), AI UX Engineer (UXE), AI Agent Engineer (AE) (All Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Welcome to the Round 3 group session. Based on the R3 interviews, we have solid draft plans for implementation phases, testing, and risk mitigation. Let's finalize the plan and then move to defining user stories and tasks.

**Facilitator:** Topic 1: Project Phases & Milestones. We saw slight variations. Let's agree on a final set. PA's 5 phases seemed comprehensive: 1: Design Finalization, 2: Core Framework Impl, 3: Step Prompt Impl, 4: Integration/Testing, 5: Release Prep. Any objections?

**(General agreement)**
**PM:** That works. Key Milestones: Blueprint Ready (End P1), Basic Chain Operational (End P2), All Steps Implemented (End P3), MVP Functionally Complete (End P4), MVP Ready for Use (End P5).

**Facilitator:** Topic 2: Testing Formality. PM/SSE highlighted the manual nature. How formally do we need to document test cases and results for MVP?
**PO:** We need defined E2E test cases covering the acceptance criteria. Results (pass/fail, key observations, link to state file if failed) must be logged simply, maybe in `TESTING_RESULTS.md`.
**SSE:** Unit/integration tests will be more informal checks by the implementer, but major issues found should still be logged.
**Facilitator:** Agreed. Formal E2E cases & results logging, informal unit/integration checks for MVP.

**Facilitator:** Topic 3: Tool Error Handling. AE/SSE raised this. How should Step Prompts report underlying tool errors?
**AE:** Best effort: If the tool call response indicates failure, or if output is missing after a tool call that should create it, the Step Prompt should output `status: "error"` and provide details in `output_data.error_message`. It shouldn't just fail silently.
**SSE:** The Orchestrator already halts on `status: "error"`, so this covers it.
**Facilitator:** Okay, Step Prompts should attempt to detect and report tool errors via their status.

**Facilitator:** Topic 4: Anti-Pattern Mitigation. We know the risks (doc drift, prompt debt, etc.). How do we ensure mitigations (reviews, standards, doc updates) happen?
**PA:** Documentation updates must be part of the task completion criteria. PM needs to track doc status.
**PM:** Agreed. Prompt reviews will be mandatory before integrating. We need to allocate time for this.
**Facilitator:** Commitment reaffirmed.

**Facilitator:** Topic 5: User Stories & Tasks (Phase 6, Step 6). We need to translate the MVP plan into actionable items. Proposal: User Stories map to major WBS items (Implement Orchestrator, Implement Step X, Implement UX Feature Y). Tasks break these down further.

**PO:** Stories should follow a standard format, e.g., "As a [User/System], I want [Action/Component], so that [Benefit]". Example: "As the System, I want the Orchestrator Core Logic implemented, so that the basic state loop can execute."
**PM:** Tasks under that Story could be: "Task: Draft Orchestrator prompt for state read/write", "Task: Implement basic step sequencing logic", "Task: Test basic loop with dummy step".
**SSE:** Tasks should include: Owner, Story points/Estimate (or timebox), Target prompt file(s), Key dependencies (e.g., depends on `state.schema.json`), Acceptance criteria for the *task*.
**PA:** We should link tasks back to relevant sections in the design documents.

**Facilitator:** Okay, let's draft some initial high-level Stories and Tasks for the key components based on the agreed phases.

**(Simulated collaborative definition of initial User Stories & Tasks - details below will be compiled into roadmap.md)**

*   **Story 1:** Implement Core Orchestration Framework
    *   Task 1.1: Implement Orchestrator state read/write logic.
    *   Task 1.2: Implement Orchestrator fixed sequencing logic.
    *   Task 1.3: Implement Orchestrator response parsing/validation shell.
    *   ... (Context: `Orchestrator.prompt`, `state.json`, `MVP_WORKFLOW.md`)
*   **Story 2:** Implement State Management Foundation
    *   Task 2.1: Finalize and commit `state.schema.json`.
    *   Task 2.2: Document auxiliary file strategy (`TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`).
    *   ...
*   **Story 3:** Implement Step Prompt Template & Contract
    *   Task 3.1: Commit `step-prompt-template.md`.
    *   Task 3.2: Draft and commit `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`.
    *   ...
*   **Story 4:** Implement Step Prompt: [Step 1 Name]
    *   Task 4.1: Draft prompt logic for Step 1 based on monoliths & contract.
    *   Task 4.2: Implement aux file handling for Step 1 (if needed).
    *   Task 4.3: Unit test Step 1 prompt.
    *   ... (Context: `step-1.prompt`, `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`, relevant monolith section)
*   **(Stories for other Step Prompts...)**
*   **Story N:** Implement UX Status Updates
    *   Task N.1: Integrate status update templates into Orchestrator.
    *   ...
*   **Story N+1:** Implement UX Checkpoints
    *   Task N+1.1: Implement checkpoint logic in Orchestrator (wait for 'continue').
    *   Task N+1.2: Implement summary generation in relevant Step Prompts.
    *   ...
*   **Story N+2:** Implement Error Handling UX
    *   Task N+2.1: Integrate error message templates into Orchestrator error path.
    *   ...

**Facilitator:** This gives us a solid start on the backlog. Phase 7 will compile this into the formal `roadmap.md`.
