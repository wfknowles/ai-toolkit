# Interview R3: Product Owner

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Product Owner (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for outlining the MVP delivery phases from a product perspective. Your Phase 4 focuses on Acceptance Testing. Any challenges defining the *specific* test cases needed, especially for validating the final artifact quality?

**Product Owner:** The challenge with artifact quality is that it's somewhat subjective. The MVP replicates a known workflow, so the primary check is: Does the output `requirements.md`/`roadmap.md` closely match the output we *know* the original monolithic prompts produced for that same MVP concept? We need a baseline "golden copy" of the expected output artifacts for comparison during acceptance testing (Step 4.2).

**Facilitator:** How involved should the PO be during the implementation sprints (your Phase 2)?

**Product Owner:** Attendance at demos/check-ins is key to provide ongoing feedback on whether the evolving functionality aligns with the requirements. Also, being available to clarify acceptance criteria or make small priority calls if implementation challenges arise.

**Facilitator:** If you were planning the project, what's your ideal structure for ensuring the product value (UX improvement, correct output) is delivered?

**Product Owner:** My ideal structure mirrors the phases I outlined:
1.  **Upfront Clarity:** Ensure requirements, acceptance criteria, and UX designs are clear *before* heavy implementation starts.
2.  **Iterative Demos:** See working pieces early and often, focusing first on the core end-to-end flow.
3.  **Dedicated UX Testing:** Explicitly test the UX features (status, checkpoints, errors).
4.  **Rigorous Acceptance Testing:** Validate against the pre-defined criteria, including the golden copy artifact comparison.

**Facilitator:** What are the biggest product-related unknowns now?

**Product Owner:**
*   Will the final artifact quality truly be equivalent to the original process, or will the automation/refactoring lose necessary detail/nuance?
*   How will real users perceive the tradeoff between automation and the optional checkpoints? Will they use the checkpoints?
*   Will the performance (latency) negatively impact the perceived UX improvement?

**Facilitator:** Any R1/R2 blindspots or potential shortcuts impacting product value?

**Product Owner:** The R1 blindspot about potentially losing user reflection time due to automation still exists. For the MVP, we accept this risk to gain the UX benefits, but it's something to evaluate post-MVP. A potential shortcut is skimping on the quality check of the final artifacts during acceptance testing, focusing only on whether the files were generated successfully.

**Facilitator:** Any product owner anti-patterns or "smells" to avoid in this context?

**Product Owner:**
*   Vague acceptance criteria.
*   Not participating in demos or providing timely feedback during implementation.
*   Trying to add features (e.g., mid-stream feedback) back into the MVP scope late in the process (scope creep).
*   Signing off on the MVP based only on functional completion without validating output quality.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for implementation?

**Product Owner:** No, the team is complete for the build. Need users for feedback later.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. The baseline artifact comparison for acceptance is a key point.
