# Interview R3: AI Orchestrator/Architect

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** AI Orchestrator/Architect (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for phasing the architectural implementation. Your Phase 1 focuses on core infrastructure. Any challenges defining the `state.schema.json` or `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` formally?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** The main challenge is capturing all necessary details *upfront* without over-engineering for the MVP. For the schema, ensuring we include necessary debug/status fields. For the contract, clearly defining the *exact* data each step consumes and produces, including the format of auxiliary file paths. Getting this right minimizes integration issues later.

**Facilitator:** You identified potential anti-patterns like tight coupling and state bloat. How would your ideal project plan mitigate these specifically?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** Mitigation involves:
1.  **Strict Interface Enforcement (Contract):** During implementation and reviews (PA's R3 point), constantly check that Step Prompts *only* use data defined in the `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` and that the Orchestrator *only* relies on the defined output structure.
2.  **Auxiliary File Discipline:** Ensure Step Prompts rigorously follow the strategy of outputting large data to files and returning only paths in the JSON. The Orchestrator should not accept large blobs directly in `output_data`.
3.  **Schema Validation (Conceptual):** While we can't programmatically validate the `state.json` against the schema easily here, the Orchestrator's parsing logic should implicitly check for expected keys based on the contract.

**Facilitator:** If you were planning the Orchestrator implementation (your Phase 2/3), how would you structure that work?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** Incrementally. Start with the basic loop (read->invoke dummy->write). Then add step sequencing logic. Then add input data injection logic. Then add response parsing/validation. Then add state updating logic (including aux file paths). Then add error handling. Then add UX integration (status, checkpoints). Test thoroughly at each increment.

**Facilitator:** What are the biggest implementation unknowns for the orchestration part now?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:**
*   The LLM's actual ability to handle the combined complexity of the *full* Orchestrator prompt (sequencing, parsing, validation, state updates, error handling, UX calls) within context limits.
*   Real-world reliability of the JSON parsing logic, especially with variations in LLM responses.
*   Performance impact of the full Orchestrator loop + `edit_file` call per step.

**Facilitator:** Any R1/R2 blindspots we should reconsider? Does the fixed chain introduce scalability concerns if we want to generalize later?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** The R1/R2 decision for a fixed chain in the MVP is sound for de-risking. It *does* mean the Orchestrator logic will need significant refactoring for future generalization (moving from a simple sequence map to dynamic step selection). The blindspot wasn't the decision itself, but perhaps understating the refactoring effort needed *later*. Designing the MVP Orchestrator with *some* modularity in how it calls steps might slightly ease that future transition.

**Facilitator:** Any architectural or state-related "smells" to avoid?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:**
*   Storing large amounts of data directly in `state.json`.
*   Orchestrator logic that makes assumptions about a Step Prompt's internal implementation.
*   Step Prompts trying to directly manipulate state beyond their defined `output_data`.
*   Lack of versioning for schema/contract/prompts.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for implementation?

**AI Orchestrator/Architect:** No, the team is right.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. The incremental implementation plan for the Orchestrator makes sense.
