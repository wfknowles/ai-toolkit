# Interview R3: Principal Architect

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Principal Architect (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for structuring the implementation project around design finalization and architectural consistency. Your Phase 1 focuses heavily on documentation (Workflow, Schema, Contract, Tech Design). Any challenges ensuring these documents are created effectively and actually used?

**Principal Architect:** The challenge is two-fold: 1) Ensuring the documents are sufficiently detailed and accurate *before* implementation starts. This requires dedicated time from the assigned owners (PA, Arch, AE) and review time from the whole team. 2) Preventing "Documentation Drift" during implementation. The best mitigation is to treat the docs as living artifacts â€“ integrate updates into the workflow. E.g., if a Step Prompt interface changes during debugging, `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` *must* be updated simultaneously.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned architectural reviews (Step 4.6). What would your ideal review process look like in this prompt-based environment?

**Principal Architect:** It would involve:
1.  Reviewing the final Orchestrator and Step Prompts against the `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`, `MVP_WORKFLOW.md`, and `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`.
2.  Checking for adherence to standards (template use, naming conventions, commenting).
3.  Looking for architectural anti-patterns (tight coupling, implicit dependencies, hardcoding).
4.  Assessing maintainability (Are prompts clear? Is logic overly complex?).
5.  Reviewing the final `state.json` structure and auxiliary file usage against the schema and design.
It's like a code review, but focused on prompt structure, clarity, and architectural alignment.

**Facilitator:** How can we best mitigate the anti-pattern of "Prompt Debt" or taking shortcuts during implementation?

**Principal Architect:** Primarily through:
*   **Clear Standards:** Having the common patterns, template, and interface contract defined upfront reduces the *need* for shortcuts.
*   **Reviews:** Catching shortcuts during prompt reviews.
*   **Time Allocation:** Acknowledging (as PM noted) that prompt engineering and debugging takes time. Rushing leads to debt. If estimates are wrong, it's better to adjust timelines than cut corners on quality/maintainability.

**Facilitator:** What are the biggest architectural unknowns remaining before starting the build?

**Principal Architect:**
*   The practical impact of the chosen state/auxiliary file strategy on overall system complexity and debuggability.
*   Whether the level of modularity achieved through separate Step Prompts is sufficient to prevent the system becoming monolithic in practice during maintenance.
*   The real-world performance characteristics (latency) and their impact on architectural choices (e.g., is the step granularity too fine?).

**Facilitator:** Any R1/R2 decisions or analyses that look like blindspots now? Specifically regarding long-term architecture or scalability?

**Principal Architect:** The R1 decision to use file I/O for state, while necessary, is the biggest scalability bottleneck. Any future attempt to significantly scale this (more users, more complex workflows) would likely require moving *off* this architecture to something with proper programmatic state management. The MVP design using auxiliary file paths is the best we can do *within* the constraint, but we should be clear that the constraint itself limits future scalability. The operational concerns (cleanup, updates) also remain a minor blindspot.

**Facilitator:** Any architectural "smells" to forbid?

**Principal Architect:**
*   Lack of comments or documentation explaining prompt logic.
*   Inconsistent naming conventions.
*   Prompts violating the defined I/O interface contract.
*   Orchestrator logic that bypasses its own state machine (e.g., hardcoded transitions).

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for implementation?

**Principal Architect:** No, the team is appropriate.

**Facilitator:** Thank you. The emphasis on documentation lifecycle and review is crucial.
