# Interview R3: AI UX Engineer

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** AI UX Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for phasing the UX implementation and testing. Your Phase 3 focuses on testing. Any challenges anticipated in evaluating the UX effectively through the manual E2E tests?

**AI UX Engineer:** The main challenge is simulating a real user's experience and perception. Manual testing by the internal team can identify functional issues (message clarity, checkpoint interaction works) but might miss how a *real* user *feels* about the flow, speed, and level of automation. Getting actual user feedback post-MVP will be essential for true UX validation.

**Facilitator:** You proposed requiring an explicit 'continue' at checkpoints. If testing shows this still feels disruptive, what's your fallback solution?

**AI UX Engineer:** If 'continue' feels too disruptive, the fallback could be a timed auto-proceed. E.g., "Phase X Complete. [Summary]. [Link]. Proceeding in 30 seconds unless you type 'pause' or provide feedback." This retains the optionality but removes the hard stop. However, implementing a reliable timer via prompts seems very difficult, so the explicit 'continue' is safer for MVP.

**Facilitator:** How would your ideal plan ensure the prompt engineers implement the UX message templates correctly and consistently?

**AI UX Engineer:** 
1.  Provide the exact templates in a shared doc.
2.  Have the Orchestrator prompt logic explicitly reference these templates when generating user-facing messages.
3.  Review the output messages during demos and E2E testing (my Phase 3.1/3.3) to check for consistency and adherence to the intended tone/clarity.

**Facilitator:** What UX unknowns are most critical now?

**AI UX Engineer:**
*   The actual perceived performance/latency and its impact on the feeling of smoothness.
*   How well the checkpoint summaries convey necessary info without being too long or too short.
*   User reaction to the specific wording of status and error messages.

**Facilitator:** Any R1/R2 UX blindspots or shortcuts we should revisit?

**AI UX Engineer:** The potential shortcut is focusing only on removing the *explicit* "Please continue" prompt, but failing to address overall *latency* or *lack of transparency*, which could lead to an equally poor perceived experience. We need to consider the holistic feel, not just eliminate one specific interaction point. The cognitive pause value remains a potential blindspot.

**Facilitator:** Any UX anti-patterns or "smells" to avoid?

**AI UX Engineer:**
*   Technical jargon in any user-facing message.
*   Inconsistent message formatting or tone.
*   Checkpoints that require reading large amounts of text to understand.
*   Error messages that don't give the user *any* indication of what went wrong or what happens next.
*   Status updates that are too frequent or not frequent enough.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs for implementation?

**AI UX Engineer:** No, the team is set.

**Facilitator:** Thanks, the fallback checkpoint idea and focus on holistic feel are useful considerations.
