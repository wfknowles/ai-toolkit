## Abstract

This document analyzes the feasibility and design of transforming the existing Meeting of the Minds (MotM) prompt-based workflow from a series of monolithic prompts into a generalized, chained process executed within the Cursor AI chat interface. The primary goals driving this exploration were to improve user experience (UX) by reducing interaction friction, enhance the applicability of the MotM process through generalization, and potentially achieve direct generation of target artifacts like requirements and roadmaps. Through simulated Subject Matter Expert (SME) analysis, individual interviews, and a group discussion, key challenges related to state management, orchestration complexity, reliability, and UX tradeoffs within the constrained chat/tooling environment were identified. A consensus was reached to pursue a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focused on implementing a *fixed* chain for the *existing* MotM workflow, prioritizing UX improvements (automation) and robust (though limited) error handling via file-based state management before tackling the complexities of generalization.

## 1. Introduction: The Problem and Concept

The current MotM process utilizes three monolithic prompts (`meeting-of-the-minds-round-1.md` through `round-3.md`) to guide users through concept development, leveraging simulated SME discussions. While functional, this approach suffers from significant UX friction, primarily the need for repeated "Please continue" prompts, breaking user flow and increasing cognitive load (AI UX Engineer Pre-Analysis). Furthermore, the prompts are tightly coupled to a specific MVP use case, limiting their broader applicability.

The concept explored was to refactor this process into a **chained workflow**. This involves breaking down the monolithic prompts into smaller, sequential steps (potentially viewed as simulated "agents"), orchestrated by a meta-prompt. The desired end state included:

*   **Improved UX:** Automated transitions between steps, minimizing user interruptions.
*   **Generalization:** Ability to apply the MotM process to diverse concepts beyond the original MVP.
*   **Direct Outputs:** Ideally generating `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md` directly from the process.
*   **Constraint:** Operate entirely within the Cursor AI chat interface, using available tools (file I/O, terminal) and without requiring manual copy/pasting.

## 2. SME Analysis and Key Challenges Identified

Seven simulated SME personas analyzed the concept and prerequisites. Several critical challenges emerged consistently:

### 2.1. State Management

Universally identified as the **core technical challenge** (All SMEs). Operating within a chat interface lacks native state persistence between turns or complex LLM calls. 
*   **Proposed Solution:** File I/O (reading/writing a state file using `edit_file`) was deemed the only viable mechanism.
*   **Risks (SSE, Arch):**
    *   *Reliability:* Tool failures, LLM errors in parsing/writing files.
    *   *Atomicity:* File writes are not atomic; failures mid-write can corrupt state.
    *   *Consistency:* Ensuring the LLM consistently interprets and updates the state structure.
*   **Format:** Strong consensus developed favoring a single, structured **JSON** file (`state.json`) for better machine readability and parsing by prompts, over less structured Markdown (Arch, SSE, PE, AE Interviews).

### 2.2. Orchestration and Chaining Logic

Managing the sequence of steps (prompts/agents) is complex.
*   **Fixed vs. Adaptive Chain (Arch Pre-Analysis):** A fixed chain (predefined linear sequence) was strongly recommended for an MVP due to lower complexity and risk compared to an adaptive chain (dynamically adjusting based on the concept), which would require sophisticated logic within the orchestrator prompt.
*   **Orchestrator Prompt Role (PE, AE Pre-Analyses):** A central meta-prompt is needed to read state, determine the next step, invoke the corresponding step-prompt (agent), process its response, handle basic error checking, and update the state file.
*   **Risk:** Overly complex instructions to the orchestrator LLM increase the chance of misinterpretation or failure (PE Interview).

### 2.3. Reliability and Error Handling

Given the reliance on prompts and tools, the system is inherently **brittle** (SSE Pre-Analysis).
*   **Error Detection:** The orchestrator needs to validate responses from step-prompts (e.g., check for expected output format, success status) (AE Interview).
*   **Error Recovery:** Automatic recovery was deemed largely infeasible for an MVP. The agreed approach is **graceful failure**: halt the chain, update state to `error`, and clearly report the issue and location to the user (PM, UXE Interviews).
*   **Tool Dependency:** The entire system hinges on the reliability of the `read_file` and `edit_file` tools (AE Pre-Analysis).

### 2.4. User Experience (UX) vs. Quality/Control

While reducing friction is paramount, concerns were raised about:
*   **"Black Box" Effect:** Fully automated chains might reduce user visibility and control (UXE Pre-Analysis).
*   **Value of Pauses:** Eliminating pauses might also remove valuable user reflection time (PO, UXE Interviews).
*   **Intermediate Artifacts:** Removing validation checkpoints (intermediate artifacts) could compromise the quality and buy-in of final outputs (PO Pre-Analysis).
*   **Proposed Solution (UXE, PO Interviews):** The "glass box" approach â€“ automate transitions, provide brief status updates, include *optional* checkpoints after major phases with summaries linking to full (hidden) artifacts.

### 2.5. Generalization Complexity

Making the workflow adaptable to diverse concepts requires prompts that can reason about input structure and tailor analysis. This was deemed a significant challenge, best deferred post-MVP (PE Pre-Analysis, PM Interview).

## 3. Proposed MVP Design and Architecture

Based on the analysis and simulated group discussion, the following MVP design was agreed upon:

1.  **Scope:** Implement the chained architecture for the *existing* MotM workflow (targeting the specific MVP concept from prerequisites).
2.  **Architecture:** A **fixed sequence** of steps mirroring the existing workflow.
3.  **Orchestration:** A single **Orchestrator Meta-Prompt** manages the flow.
4.  **State Management:** A single **`state.json`** file containing `workflow_id`, `schema_version`, `concept_input`, `current_step`, `status`, `error_message`, and a nested `data` object for step outputs. Managed via `edit_file`.
5.  **Step Execution (Agent Simulation):**
    *   Orchestrator invokes Step Prompt.
    *   Step Prompt receives necessary data, performs task.
    *   Step Prompt outputs a JSON block containing `status` (`success`/`error`) and `output_data`.
    *   Orchestrator parses/validates response, updates `state.json` atomically (single `edit_file` call if possible).
6.  **Error Handling:** Orchestrator detects failure (bad response, agent error status), sets `state.status = 'error'`, halts, reports clearly to user.
7.  **User Experience:** Automated step transitions, brief chat status updates (e.g., "*Status: Step X running...*"), optional checkpoints after major phases (e.g., end of Round 1 analysis) offering summaries and links to generated artifacts (which are created but not displayed by default).

## 4. Tradeoffs and Limitations

The proposed MVP design makes specific tradeoffs:
*   **Simplicity over Flexibility:** Prioritizes a robust (as possible) fixed chain over a more complex, potentially brittle, adaptive one.
*   **UX Improvement over Full Automation:** Incorporates optional checkpoints, slightly compromising pure automation for user visibility and validation.
*   **Graceful Failure over Automatic Recovery:** Accepts that errors will likely require halting the process, focusing on clear reporting.

**Key Limitations:**
*   **Brittleness:** Remains susceptible to LLM inconsistencies and tool failures.
*   **Maintainability:** Complex prompts can be hard to debug and maintain.
*   **Performance:** Multiple file I/O operations may introduce latency.
*   **Simulated Depth:** The quality of the simulated SME interaction might be less nuanced than the original monolithic prompts.

## 5. Conclusion and Next Steps

The exploration concluded that while a fully generalized, automated, and intuitive MotM chained workflow within Cursor AI presents significant technical challenges, an MVP focused on improving the UX of the existing workflow via chaining is feasible and valuable. The proposed design using a fixed chain, JSON state file, careful orchestration, and a "glass box" UX approach represents a pragmatic path forward.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Develop the detailed `state.json` schema.
2.  Implement the Orchestrator Meta-Prompt logic.
3.  Refactor the existing MotM prompts into focused Step Prompts adhering to the input/output JSON standard.
4.  Implement the UX elements (status updates, optional checkpoints).
5.  Rigorously test the MVP chain within the Cursor environment, focusing on reliability and error handling.
6.  Gather user feedback on the MVP's UX and output quality.
7.  Evaluate feasibility and plan for post-MVP generalization based on MVP performance and feedback.
