**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Prompt Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for sharing your pre-analysis. Let's dive deeper. You highlighted generalization and state management as key challenges. Do you see any *inherent* challenges in trying to generalize this MotM process via prompts within Cursor?

**Prompt Engineer:** Inherently, yes. Prompts are good at instruction following but struggle with true *reasoning* about unseen concepts without very careful construction. Generalizing means the prompt needs to understand the *structure* of the MotM process separate from the *content* of a specific concept. This requires a level of abstraction that's hard to achieve reliably. Also, prompt injection or misinterpretation becomes a bigger risk with complex, state-dependent prompts.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned the risk of context loss or drift in chains. Do you anticipate hard limits here, like the context window size or the reliability of file I/O acting as memory?

**Prompt Engineer:** Absolutely. Context windows are finite. If the state we need to pass between steps (concept details, prior analysis summaries, decisions) exceeds the window, the prompt for the next step won't have the full picture. File I/O *mitigates* this but introduces its own limits – tool failures, read/write errors, potential for the LLM to hallucinate file contents or fail to parse them correctly. The hard limit is the reliability of the tool chain and context management.

**Facilitator:** If you were to design the prompt structure for this chained solution, what would it look like?

**Prompt Engineer:** I'd lean towards a clear separation:
1.  **Orchestrator Meta-Prompt:** Manages the overall flow. Reads the state file, determines the next step, formats the input for the step-prompt, and calls it. Critically, it would handle basic error checking (e.g., did the expected output file get created?).
2.  **Step-Specific Prompts (Agents):** Highly focused. Each takes standardized input (from the orchestrator, based on the state file), performs its specific task (e.g., "Analyze challenges for Concept X based on Persona Y"), and outputs in a standardized format (perhaps structured markdown or JSON snippet) to be written back to the state file. Minimize ambiguity in these prompts. Use clear input/output markers.
3.  **State File:** Probably JSON managed via `edit_file`, containing keys for `current_step`, `concept_details`, `accumulated_analysis`, `error_flag`, etc. Prompts would instruct the LLM to read specific keys and generate updates for specific keys.

**Facilitator:** What unknowns or questions do you think need answering most urgently?

**Prompt Engineer:**
*   How consistently can the LLM parse and update a structured state file (like JSON) via prompts and file edits? Needs testing.
*   What's the *minimum* state required to pass between steps for effective analysis vs. what fits reliably in context/file I/O?
*   Can the orchestrator prompt reliably handle basic error conditions (e.g., file not found, step output missing) and guide recovery?

**Facilitator:** Any blindspots in the current concept?

**Prompt Engineer:** The biggest blindspot might be underestimating the "human element" simulation. Can prompts truly replicate the nuance of SME debate and synthesis effectively enough to produce high-quality requirements/roadmaps without the explicit back-and-forth and artifact review of the current process? We might be optimizing UX at the cost of depth. Also, the "intuition" aspect feels like a potential blindspot – relying too much on the LLM to guess intent rather than designing clear processes.

**Facilitator:** Based on this specific goal (generalizing MotM workflow), do you think any SMEs are missing from *this round* who should be included later?

**Prompt Engineer:** For this *meta-task* of designing the workflow itself, the current group seems appropriate. If we were *running* the generalized workflow on a highly technical or domain-specific concept later, we'd absolutely need relevant domain SMEs for that specific run. But for designing the *process* infrastructure, this group covers the key angles (prompts, architecture, UX, product).

**Facilitator:** Thanks, that's very helpful.
