# Interview: AI UX Engineer

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** AI UX Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Your pre-analysis clearly articulated the core UX problem and the challenges of designing a smooth chained experience within chat. You proposed a "glass box" approach with status updates and optional checkpoints. How frequently should these updates or checkpoints occur to balance flow and transparency?

**AI UX Engineer:** Not too frequently, or we recreate the interruption problem. Status updates should be brief and asynchronous – maybe just updating a single line in the chat like "*Status: Running Step X...*". Checkpoints should be reserved for major phase completions (e.g., after all initial analyses are done, before synthesis starts). The key is making them *optional* – the user can ignore them and let the chain proceed, or they can pause and review.

**Facilitator:** How would you design the error handling experience to be least disruptive?

**AI UX Engineer:** Clarity and simplicity are vital. 
1.  **Clear Message:** Avoid jargon. "The process stopped at the 'Synthesize Solutions' step because I couldn't read the analysis file."
2.  **State Indication:** Point the user to the state file (`state.json` mentioned by others) if manual review is needed.
3.  **Simple Options:** Offer limited, clear choices like "Try running this step again?" or "Stop the process?". Avoid overwhelming the user with complex recovery paths.
4.  **Progress Saving:** Ensure the failure doesn't lose all progress; the state file should reflect work up to the failure point.

**Facilitator:** Regarding the intermediate artifacts – the PO and Engineer suggested generating them but hiding them unless needed. Does that align with your UX view?

**AI UX Engineer:** Yes, that's a good compromise. It supports the "glass box" idea. The data is there if needed for debugging or deep dives, but it doesn't clutter the primary user flow. The link at the optional checkpoint could reveal the full artifact if the user chooses.

**Facilitator:** How can we make the initial concept input more intuitive for a generalized process?

**AI UX Engineer:** Instead of just `/motm <freeform text>`, maybe the initial interaction could be a mini-dialogue:
*   AI: "What concept would you like to explore with Meeting of the Minds?"
*   User: "[Concept Description]"
*   AI: "Got it. To help tailor the analysis, could you briefly state the primary goal? (Optional)"
*   User: "[Goal]"
*   AI: "Thanks! Initiating the process... *Status: Analyzing...*"
This gathers a bit more structure upfront without being overly burdensome.

**Facilitator:** What are the biggest unknowns for you regarding the user experience?

**AI UX Engineer:**
*   The actual user tolerance for automation vs. control in this kind of creative/analytical task.
*   Whether the status updates and optional checkpoints are sufficient to prevent the "black box" feeling.
*   How users will react to failures, even if handled gracefully – will it destroy trust in the process?

**Facilitator:** Any blindspots you perceive from a UX perspective?

**AI UX Engineer:** We might be overly focused on the *efficiency* of the workflow and underestimating the *value* of the pauses in the current system. Do those pauses give the user time to think and reflect, which might be lost in a fully automated chain? We need to be careful not to optimize the flow at the expense of the quality of user thought.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs?

**AI UX Engineer:** Agree with PO – no SMEs missing for this design phase, but real user testing is essential post-MVP.

**Facilitator:** Great points on balancing automation and cognitive space. Thanks!
