# Interview: Senior Software Engineer

**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Senior Software Engineer (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for your detailed analysis, particularly the focus on the practicalities of state management and reliability. You mentioned atomicity and error handling as key concerns for file-based state. Do you see any inherent friction points beyond the obvious tool failures?

**Senior Software Engineer:** The main friction is the impedance mismatch between a stateful, logical process and an interface driven by stateless LLM calls orchestrated via text prompts. Every step requires marshalling state into a prompt, executing, parsing the output, and unmarshalling results back into a file. It's inherently inefficient and error-prone compared to code execution. The lack of transactions is a big one â€“ if a step involves multiple file writes (e.g., update state, create artifact), a failure partway through leaves the system in an inconsistent state.

**Facilitator:** If you had to implement this within the current constraints, how would your solution look from an engineering perspective?

**Senior Software Engineer:** Minimize complexity and maximize robustness:
1.  **State:** Use a single JSON file (`state.json`) as the source of truth, as proposed by the Architect. Enforce a strict schema.
2.  **Orchestration:** A master orchestrator prompt, as described by the Prompt Engineer. Its logic should be *very* simple: determine the next step based on `state.current_step`, load *only* the necessary data from the state file into the step-prompt context, execute the step-prompt, attempt to parse the result, and *atomically* (as much as possible) update the state file. This means the step-prompt output should ideally contain *all* necessary state updates in one block.
3.  **Step Prompts:** Keep them focused on a single task. Their output should be structured (e.g., a JSON block within the markdown response) for easier parsing by the orchestrator.
4.  **Error Handling:** The orchestrator needs to check for the *presence* and basic *validity* (e.g., parseable JSON) of the output from the step-prompt. If invalid or missing, update `state.status` to `error` and halt. Recovery would likely require manual intervention by the user to fix the state file or restart.
5.  **Artifacts:** Generate them *after* the state update for that step is confirmed, if possible, to reduce inconsistency risk.

**Facilitator:** What are the biggest unknowns or areas needing investigation?

**Senior Software Engineer:**
*   Can the `edit_file` tool reliably *replace* a specific JSON block within a file based on prompt instructions, or does it always rewrite the whole file? Rewriting increases the risk of corruption on failure.
*   What is the realistic performance impact (latency) of multiple file reads/writes per logical step?
*   How robust is the LLM's JSON parsing/generation capability when guided by prompts, especially with nested structures?

**Facilitator:** You raised the point about UX vs. Reliability. Where do you land on the necessity of intermediate artifacts?

**Senior Software Engineer:** From a reliability standpoint, they are useful *debug* artifacts. If the chain fails, having the output of the last successful step makes diagnosis easier. For the *user*, I agree with the UX/PO view that they can be disruptive. Maybe the solution is to generate them but don't explicitly *show* them to the user unless an error occurs or they request a status check? Store them quietly in the background.

**Facilitator:** Any blindspots you perceive?

**Senior Software Engineer:** We might be underestimating the difficulty of writing prompts that *consistently* make the LLM perform these file manipulations and state updates correctly across many steps. Subtle variations in LLM responses could break the chain. Testing all possible failure modes in this prompt-driven system is also incredibly difficult.

**Facilitator:** Any missing SMEs needed later?

**Senior Software Engineer:** Echoing the Architect: If we hit persistent, weird failures related to the toolchain or LLM consistency, someone with deep infra/model-level knowledge might be needed for debugging. Otherwise, this group is fine for the design phase.

**Facilitator:** Great, thank you for the pragmatic insights.
