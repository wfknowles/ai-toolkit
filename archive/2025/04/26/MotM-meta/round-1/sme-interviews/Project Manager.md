# Interview: Project Manager

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Project Manager (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for laying out the project perspective, especially the risks and potential phasing. You identified technical feasibility as a high risk. How would you propose mitigating that risk in the project plan?

**Project Manager:** Mitigation comes through incremental development and early testing. That's why the MVP scope suggested by the PO (replicating the existing workflow with the new chained architecture) is crucial. 
1.  **De-risk the core:** Focus *only* on getting the state management and basic chain orchestration working reliably for a known, fixed process first. 
2.  **Test rigorously:** Test the file I/O, state parsing, and step transitions heavily within the Cursor environment. Identify failure points early.
3.  **Define clear metrics:** How do we define "working reliably"? Success rate of chains? Manual recovery needed?
4.  **Postpone generalization:** Don't even attempt adaptive logic or generalization until the core mechanism is proven stable.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned the challenge of managing sequential dependencies and failures. How would your ideal solution handle a failure mid-chain?

**Project Manager:** Ideally? The orchestrator detects the failure (e.g., step N didn't update the state file correctly), marks the state as `error`, stops the chain, and clearly informs the user: "Process stopped at Step N due to [error type]. State saved to `state.json`. You may need to manually review/correct the state or restart the process." Realistically, automatic *recovery* is probably out of scope given the constraints. The goal is graceful failure and clear reporting.

**Facilitator:** Let's talk artifacts. From a project tracking and quality perspective, how do you feel about the push to minimize them?

**Project Manager:** I understand the UX driver, but from a PM perspective, intermediate artifacts are valuable deliverables and checkpoints. They demonstrate progress and allow for verification against requirements. The PO's suggestion of generating them but only showing summaries seems like a reasonable compromise. We still *produce* the evidence of work (useful for debugging and tracking), but we don't burden the user unless necessary.

**Facilitator:** How would you structure the work? Your WBS is helpful. Would you prioritize the state management design first?

**Project Manager:** Absolutely. WBS 1.3 (Define State Management Strategy) and 1.4 (Define Orchestration Logic) are the foundations. We need agreement on the state schema (JSON seems favored) and the basic orchestrator logic *before* writing any step-specific prompts. Then, implement the simplest possible end-to-end chain (WBS 2.0) using that foundation.

**Facilitator:** What are the biggest unknowns or questions for you?

**Project Manager:**
*   What is the realistic effort required to achieve *robust* state management and orchestration via prompts? It feels potentially very high and iterative.
*   How do we effectively test and validate this prompt-driven system across different scenarios and potential edge cases?
*   What are the actual limitations of the `edit_file` tool regarding file size, frequency of edits, and reliability?

**Facilitator:** Any blindspots in the concept?

**Project Manager:** A key blindspot could be the maintainability of this system. If the prompts become extremely complex and interdependent, modifying or debugging them later could be a nightmare compared to actual code. We need to emphasize clarity and modularity in prompt design from the start.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs?

**Project Manager:** No, the team covers the necessary skills for this design phase. We'll need user testers later, as the PO mentioned.

**Facilitator:** Very clear. Thank you for the project management perspective.
