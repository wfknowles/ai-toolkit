# Interview: Product Owner

**Date:** 2025-04-26
**Facilitator:** AI Assistant
**Interviewee:** Product Owner (Simulated)

**Facilitator:** Thanks for focusing on the value proposition and user experience aspects. You highlighted the desire to reduce friction but also the potential risks of a "black box" and losing validation checkpoints. How would your ideal solution balance these?

**Product Owner:** The ideal is a "glass box," not a black box. The user shouldn't *have* to intervene constantly, but they should have *visibility* and *optional* points of control. My ideal solution would:
1.  Automate the step-to-step transitions by default (eliminate "Please continue").
2.  Provide concise status updates in the chat (e.g., "Phase 1 Analysis Complete. Starting Phase 2 Synthesis...").
3.  Offer optional checkpoints, perhaps after major phases. Like: "Phase 1 Summary: [Brief summary]. View full details [link to artifact]? Reply 'continue' or provide feedback."
4.  Prioritize clear error reporting and, if technically feasible, simple recovery options (like "retry step").

**Facilitator:** Regarding generalization â€“ you noted the need to ask the *right* questions for any concept. How do you envision that working from a product perspective?

**Product Owner:** That's tough within the constraints. Ideally, the initial prompt where the user inputs the concept would also guide them to provide key context (e.g., "What is the goal? Who is the user? What are the constraints?"). The orchestrator prompt would then use this structured input to tailor the parameters or sub-prompts used in later steps. It might not be perfect "intuition," but structured input helps guide the process toward relevance.

**Facilitator:** The request questions the necessity of intermediate artifacts. What's your take on completely removing them versus making them optional/summarized?

**Product Owner:** Completely removing them feels too risky for quality and buy-in. I strongly lean towards **summarized updates with optional deep dives**. Generate the detailed artifact (as the Engineer suggested, perhaps store it quietly), but only present a summary or key findings to the user at checkpoints. They can choose to drill down if needed. This respects the user's flow while retaining the validation benefit.

**Facilitator:** You mentioned an MVP for this meta-concept. What would that look like?

**Product Owner:** MVP: Replicate the *existing* MotM MVP workflow (the one defined in the prerequisites) but using the new *chained* architecture. Focus solely on eliminating the "Please continue" interruptions and implementing the file-based state management for that known, fixed workflow. *Do not* tackle generalization or adaptive logic yet. Prove the core chaining mechanism and improved UX first with a known scope.

**Facilitator:** What are the biggest unknowns or questions from your perspective?

**Product Owner:**
*   Will users trust a more automated process, or will the lack of constant interaction feel disconcerting?
*   Can the summarized checkpoints provide enough context for meaningful validation without forcing users to read lengthy artifacts anyway?
*   How much slower will the chained process *feel* to the user compared to the stop-start monoliths, even if total time is similar?

**Facilitator:** Any blindspots?

**Product Owner:** We might be assuming the primary value is just speed/reduced friction. If the current monolithic process, despite its clunkiness, forces deeper user reflection at each step, automating it might lead to more superficial engagement with the concept development, even if it feels smoother.

**Facilitator:** Missing SMEs needed later?

**Product Owner:** For this phase, no. Once we have an MVP, getting actual user feedback (from the target users of the MotM process) would be critical for the next iteration.

**Facilitator:** Excellent, thank you for clarifying the product vision and priorities.
