# Project Manager - Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Concept Analyzed:** Transitioning the MotM process from monolithic prompts to a generalized, chained workflow within Cursor AI to improve UX and directly output requirements/roadmap.

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** Existing MotM prompts, MVP requirements/roadmap.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

1.  **Project Scope:** The core goal is to refactor an existing process for better UX and broader applicability. Key deliverables are the new chained prompt system (or meta-prompt orchestrator) and the final `requirements.md`/`roadmap.md` outputs.
2.  **Risks:**
    *   **Technical Feasibility:** High risk due to reliance on prompt engineering and file I/O for state/orchestration within a constrained environment. Brittleness, error handling failures.
    *   **Generalization Complexity:** Ensuring the process works reliably for diverse concepts is complex and may require significant iteration.
    *   **Quality Control:** Removing intermediate artifacts/checkpoints might speed things up but risks lower quality outputs or outputs that don't match user intent.
    *   **Scope Creep:** The desire for "intuition" and complex generalization could lead to expanding requirements beyond what's achievable reliably.
    *   **Tooling Limitations:** The project is fundamentally constrained by the Cursor AI chat interface and available tools.
3.  **Process Flow:** A chained approach implies sequential dependencies. A failure in one step blocks the entire process. How will this be managed? What are the recovery procedures?
4.  **Resource Allocation (Simulated):** This meta-project itself involves multiple SME personas (simulated). Coordinating their inputs (even simulated ones) requires careful orchestration by the meta-prompt.
5.  **Timeline & Milestones:** How would we phase this?
    *   Phase 1: Design the core chain structure and state management approach.
    *   Phase 2: Implement a basic, fixed chain for the original MVP concept (focus on UX improvement).
    *   Phase 3: Tackle generalization - develop logic for adapting the chain to different concepts.
    *   Phase 4: Refine error handling, reporting, and final output generation.
6.  **Assumptions & Dependencies:**
    *   Assumes LLM can reliably follow complex instructions involving file I/O and state logic.
    *   Assumes file system operations via tools are consistently available and performant.
    *   Depends heavily on the quality and design of the orchestrator and step-specific prompts.
7.  **Artifact Management:** While the goal is to reduce intermediate artifacts for the *user*, the process *itself* might need internal state files. Managing these (naming conventions, cleanup, versioning if iterative) is important.

**Potential Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - High Level:**

1.0 Define Core Workflow Requirements
    1.1 Analyze Existing Monoliths
    1.2 Define Generalized Steps
    1.3 Define State Management Strategy
    1.4 Define Orchestration Logic
2.0 Develop Prompt Chain V1 (MVP Concept)
    2.1 Create Orchestrator Prompt
    2.2 Develop Step-Specific Prompts
    2.3 Implement File I/O for State
    2.4 Test & Refine UX (Reduced Friction)
3.0 Develop Generalization Capability
    3.1 Design Concept Parsing Logic
    3.2 Implement Adaptive Chain Logic (if needed)
    3.3 Test with Diverse Concepts
4.0 Finalize Output Generation & Error Handling
    4.1 Implement `requirements.md`/`roadmap.md` Synthesis
    4.2 Develop Error Detection & Reporting
    4.3 Implement Recovery Options (if feasible)

**Key Question:** What is the simplest, most robust implementation (MVP) of this chained concept that delivers tangible UX improvement (reduced interruptions) for a defined scope, mitigating the significant technical risks associated with state management and orchestration within the given constraints?

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### Project Planning
- The roadmap and requirements provide a clear phased approach (setup, integration, polish).
- Sprints should be short (1-2 weeks) with clear DoD for each milestone.
- Early focus on infrastructure, tool reliability, and API contract is critical.

### Risk Management
- Key risks: unclear requirements, integration issues between extension and backend, LLM context limitations, and security lapses.
- Mitigation: regular backlog grooming, early integration tests, security reviews, and clear documentation.
- Track error rates and user feedback as leading indicators of risk.

### Team Coordination
- Cross-functional collaboration (PE, AOA, SSE, UXE, AE) is essential for success.
- Regular standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure alignment.
- Encourage early and frequent feedback from all roles, especially on UX and error handling.

### Delivery Milestones
- Phase 1: Project setup, tool implementation, and API contract.
- Phase 2: Core workflow integration, agent logic, and UI/UX.
- Phase 3: MVP polish, documentation, and internal demo.
- Each phase should have clear acceptance criteria and demoable outputs.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Managing scope creep and prioritizing MVP features.
- Ensuring timely feedback loops between backend and frontend teams.
- Adapting to changes in LLM capabilities or API constraints.

### Open Questions
- What are the most likely blockers for each phase?
- How to best track and communicate progress to stakeholders?
- What is the escalation path for critical bugs or integration failures?
