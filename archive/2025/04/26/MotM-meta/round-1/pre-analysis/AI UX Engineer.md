# AI UX Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Concept Analyzed:** Improving the user experience of the MotM prompt-based workflow by moving from interrupt-driven monoliths to a smoother, potentially automated, chained process within Cursor AI's chat interface.

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** Existing MotM prompts, MVP requirements/roadmap.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

1.  **Core UX Problem:** The primary pain point identified is the high interaction cost and cognitive load caused by the frequent "Please continue" prompts in the monolithic structure. This breaks the user's flow and makes the process feel cumbersome.
2.  **Proposed Solution: Chaining:** Automating the transitions between steps via chaining directly addresses the core problem. The goal is a more fluid, less interruptive experience.
3.  **UX Challenges of Chaining:**
    *   **Lack of Visibility/Control:** If the chain runs fully automatically, the user might feel a loss of control or understanding of the process. It becomes a "black box." How do we provide appropriate feedback and transparency without reintroducing interruptions?
    *   **Error Handling Experience:** How are errors surfaced to the user? A sudden, unexplained failure is a terrible UX. Error messages need to be clear, and recovery options (if possible) should be intuitive.
    *   **Perceived Performance:** Long-running chains without feedback can feel slow or stalled. Progress indicators or periodic summaries might be needed.
    *   **Onboarding/Intuitiveness:** How does the user initiate the process? Is it clear what concept information is needed upfront? How intuitive is the generalized input compared to the previously specific prompts?
4.  **Role of Intermediate Artifacts:** The request questions their necessity. From a UX perspective:
    *   **Pro:** Removing them simplifies the flow and reduces clutter.
    *   **Con:** They can act as crucial checkpoints for user validation, understanding, and course correction. Removing them might lead to the final output being misaligned with user expectations, requiring more rework later.
    *   **Mitigation:** Could we use collapsible sections, summaries, or optional review steps to balance detail and flow?
5.  **Generalization Impact:** A generalized process needs to be intuitive for various inputs. This requires careful design of the initial interaction and potentially some guidance or examples for the user on how to formulate their concept effectively.
6.  **Interface Limitations:** Designing an ideal UX is heavily constrained by the Cursor AI chat interface. We can't build custom UI elements. Interactions are limited to text prompts and responses, plus tool outputs (like file links). We must work within these limitations.

**Ideal User Journey (Conceptual):**

1.  User: `/motm <concept description>`
2.  AI: "Okay, initiating the Meeting of the Minds process for your concept: '<concept summary>'. I'll analyze this with simulated experts and generate requirements and a roadmap. This may take a few moments. I'll provide updates.
    *   *Status: Analyzing concept with Prompt Engineer...*"
3.  AI: "*Status: Simulating initial SME discussions...*"
4.  *(Optional Checkpoint)* AI: "Based on initial analysis, the key themes emerging are X, Y, Z. [Expand for details]. Does this align with your expectations before I proceed with deeper discussion? (Reply 'continue' or provide feedback)"
5.  AI: "*Status: Synthesizing solutions...*"
6.  AI: "Process complete. Here are the generated files:
    *   `</path/to/requirements.md>`
    *   `</path/to/roadmap.md>`" 
7.  *(Error Scenario)* AI: "I encountered an issue while [specific step]. Error: [details]. Would you like me to retry, or stop the process?"

**Key Question:** How can we design the interaction flow and feedback mechanisms for a chained, prompt-based process within the chat interface to maximize perceived smoothness and reduce cognitive load, while providing sufficient transparency, control points (if needed), and effective error handling to build user trust and ensure high-quality outcomes?

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### User Experience
- The primary UX goal is to eliminate copy/paste and minimize friction in agent interactions.
- The chat interface should feel native to Cursor IDE, with clear, responsive feedback for all actions.
- Code insertion must be previewed and confirmed by the user, with a clear diff and context display.

### Interface Design
- Use VSCode Webview for a modern, accessible chat UI.
- Display conversation history, agent status, and active file context.
- Provide clear indicators for backend connection and agent activity.

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Implement thumbs up/down or similar feedback on agent responses.
- Show success/failure messages for all tool actions.
- Allow users to undo code insertions if possible.

### Error Handling
- User-facing error messages must be clear, concise, and actionable (no jargon).
- Guide users through recovery steps when errors occur (retry, clarify, abort).
- Log user feedback and error events for continuous improvement.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Balancing automation with user control (especially for code changes).
- Ensuring accessibility and responsiveness in the UI.
- Designing for trustâ€”users must feel confident in agent actions.

### Open Questions
- What are the most common user pain points in current workflows?
- How to best visualize code changes and context for non-expert users?
- What onboarding or help features are needed for first-time users?
