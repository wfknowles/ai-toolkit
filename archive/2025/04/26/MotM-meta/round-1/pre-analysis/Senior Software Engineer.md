# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Concept Analyzed:** Refactoring a prompt-based workflow (MotM) from monoliths to a chain within a chat/markdown environment (Cursor AI), focusing on generalization, UX, and direct artifact generation.

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** Existing MotM prompts, MVP requirements/roadmap.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

1.  **Feasibility & Constraints:** Building a robust, stateful workflow purely through prompts and file I/O in a chat interface is technically challenging and likely brittle. It's essentially simulating an application without actual code execution guarantees. The "no copy/paste" and "chat only" constraints are severe.
2.  **State Management:** File-based state (`state.md`/`state.json`) is the likely approach. Concerns:
    *   **Atomicity:** File writes aren't atomic. What happens if a tool call fails mid-write?
    *   **Concurrency:** Not an issue for a single user chat, but important if this concept were ever expanded.
    *   **Error Handling:** How does the orchestrator prompt detect and recover from failed file reads/writes or corrupted state?
    *   **Data Format:** Markdown is human-readable but harder to parse reliably by prompts than JSON. JSON is better for structured data but less readable.
3.  **Generalization Logic:** Implementing the logic to generalize (parse concept, adapt steps) within prompts is complex. LLMs can do this, but consistency and accuracy aren't guaranteed. Hardcoding paths or relying on specific file names helps but reduces flexibility.
4.  **Chaining Implementation:** Each "link" in the chain would be a complex prompt instructing the AI to:
    *   Load state from a file.
    *   Load necessary inputs.
    *   Perform analysis/simulation.
    *   Generate outputs (including updates to the state file).
    This is a lot of instruction and prone to misunderstanding or execution errors by the AI.
5.  **UX vs. Reliability:** Automating steps to improve UX (remove "Please continue") increases the risk of unrecoverable errors. A failure mid-chain without user intervention might require starting over. The current monolithic approach, while clunky, might be more robust because more context is handled in one go.
6.  **Alternative - Tooling:** If Cursor AI allowed defining custom tools (e.g., a Python script execution tool), this would be much more feasible. A script could manage state, orchestrate LLM calls, handle errors, etc., far more reliably than prompts alone.
7.  **Intermediate Artifacts:** Are they truly unnecessary? They serve as checkpoints and allow for verification/correction. Removing them entirely might lead to lower quality final outputs if the compressed/implicit simulation isn't perfect.

**Pseudocode (Illustrative State Update):**

```python
# Conceptual representation - Not executable in this context

def execute_chain_step(step_prompt_template, concept_data, state_file_path):
    try:
        # 1. Read current state
        state = read_state_from_file(state_file_path)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(f"Failed to read state: {e}")
        return # Error: cannot proceed

    # 2. Prepare step-specific prompt
    prompt = fill_template(step_prompt_template, concept_data, state)

    # 3. Execute LLM call (simulate analysis/discussion)
    llm_output = call_llm(prompt)

    try:
        # 4. Parse LLM output for results and next state info
        step_results, next_state_data = parse_llm_output(llm_output)

        # 5. Write step results (if any)
        write_step_artifacts(step_results)

        # 6. Update state object
        state.update(next_state_data)
        state['last_completed_step'] = current_step_name

        # 7. Write updated state back to file (critical section)
        write_state_to_file(state_file_path, state)

    except Exception as e:
        log_error(f"Failed during step execution or state update: {e}")
        # Potential rollback or error state needed here
        return # Error: step failed

    return # Success

```

**Key Question:** Given the constraints (chat interface, prompts, file I/O only), can we design a file-based state mechanism and prompt chaining strategy that is sufficiently robust to handle potential tool failures, LLM inconsistencies, and context limitations without requiring user intervention for error recovery, making the improved UX viable?

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### Implementation Feasibility
- The FastAPI backend and VSCode extension architecture is feasible and aligns with modern best practices.
- Async tool execution (aiofiles) and strict path validation are critical for reliability and security.
- Dockerization will simplify local deployment and testing.

### Code Structure
- Recommend a modular backend structure: `api/`, `core/`, `tools/`, `services/`, `tests/`.
- Use Pydantic models for API contracts and tool schemas.
- Implement Dependency Injection for testability.

### Testing & Quality
- Unit tests for all tool logic, especially file I/O and error handling.
- Integration tests for end-to-end agent workflows.
- Mock external dependencies (filesystem, Gemini API) in tests.
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated testing on PRs.

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between extension, backend, and tools.
- Use logging and observability for debugging and monitoring.
- Document configuration and setup thoroughly (README, .env).

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Handling edge cases in file operations and user input.
- Ensuring robust error handling and user feedback.
- Managing context window and prompt size limitations.

### Open Questions
- How to best structure tool schemas for future extensibility?
- What are the performance implications of large files or long conversations?
- How to support undo/rollback for code insertions?
