# Prompt Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Concept Analyzed:** Generalizing the 3-monolith MotM prompt process into a more intuitive, potentially chained, markdown-based workflow within Cursor AI, minimizing UX friction and aiming for direct `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md` generation.

**Prerequisites Reviewed:**
*   `meeting-of-the-minds-round-1.md`
*   `meeting-of-the-minds-round-2.md`
*   `meeting-of-the-minds-round-3.md`
*   `MotM-mvp/requirements.md`
*   `MotM-mvp/roadmap.md`
*   `MotM-mvp/` directory contents (assumed general context)

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

1.  **Generalization:** Abstracting the current MVP-focused prompts requires identifying core MotM steps vs. concept-specific variables. How can prompts dynamically adapt questions/artifacts based on the input concept?
2.  **Chaining & State:** The primary hurdle is state management within Cursor's chat/tool context without manual intervention. File I/O for state passing is possible but fragile (error handling, context limits). The "no copy/paste" rule makes this significantly harder. How can essential context (evolving requirements, decisions) persist reliably?
3.  **Intuition:** Having the AI "intuit" steps likely means a sophisticated orchestrator prompt that generates sub-prompts or uses few-shot learning based on the concept. This increases complexity and potential for hallucination.
4.  **UX:** Eliminating "Please continue" requires a more autonomous flow. Chaining *could* achieve this if state/logic allows. Reducing artifacts might streamline UX but risks superficial analysis. Is the current artifact depth essential for quality?
5.  **Tooling:** Markdown/chat/tooling limitations make robust application behavior (error handling, complex logic) difficult. File I/O is the main state mechanism available.
6.  **Direct Output:** Concept -> `requirements.md`/`roadmap.md` is ambitious. The current process builds towards this through iterative discussion. A streamlined version needs to effectively compress this analysis/synthesis.

**Diagrammatic Thought (Conceptual):**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input: Concept] --> B(Orchestrator Prompt);
    B --> C{Parse Concept};
    C --> D[Generate/Execute Chain];
    D -- File State --> D;
    D --> E[Synthesize Outputs];
    E --> F[requirements.md];
    E --> G[roadmap.md];

    subgraph Chain Execution
        direction LR
        D1(Step 1 Prompt) --> D2(Step 2 Prompt) --> D3(...)
    end

    subgraph State Management (Files)
        D1 --> S[/state.md];
        S --> D2;
    end
    style S fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px

```

**Key Question:** Can a prompt-driven, file-based state machine within Cursor reliably manage the complexity and depth required for the MotM process across multiple turns, handling potential errors and context limitations, while meeting the UX goal of minimal user intervention? 

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### Prompt Design
- The MCP should leverage modular, composable prompts that can be dynamically constructed based on user intent, context, and tool invocation.
- Prompts must be structured to support function calling (Gemini Pro) and robust error handling, as outlined in the requirements.
- System prompts should clearly define agent persona, tool usage, and error handling policies.

### State Management
- State should be managed in a way that preserves conversation history, tool results, and user context (active file, selection) across turns.
- Consider using a lightweight state object passed between the extension and backend, avoiding persistent storage unless necessary for UX.

### Integration with Cursor IDE
- Since direct model API access is not possible, prompt servers must act as intermediaries, receiving context and user input from the IDE and returning agent responses.
- The extension should handle context gathering and pass it to the backend for prompt assembly.
- Avoid copy/paste by using the extension's API for code insertion and context retrieval.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Ensuring prompt reliability and clarity for function calling.
- Balancing prompt complexity with maintainability.
- Handling edge cases in tool invocation and error reporting.

### Open Questions
- How to best modularize prompts for extensibility?
- What are the limits of prompt size and context window in Gemini Pro?
- How to ensure seamless UX when agent actions require user confirmation (e.g., code insertion)?
