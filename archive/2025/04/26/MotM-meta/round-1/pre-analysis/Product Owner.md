# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Concept Analyzed:** Generalizing the Meeting of the Minds (MotM) process from 3 monolithic prompts to a more flexible, chained workflow within Cursor AI. Key goals: improved UX (less friction, fewer interruptions), adaptability to different concepts, and direct generation of `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md`.

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** Existing MotM prompts (`round-1` to `round-3`), MVP requirements/roadmap.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

1.  **Value Proposition:** The core value is streamlining a complex ideation/planning process and making it more accessible within the user's existing workflow (Cursor AI). Reducing the "Please continue" friction is a significant UX win. Generalization increases the applicability and potential ROI of the MotM framework.
2.  **User Experience (UX):**
    *   **Friction Reduction:** Moving to a more automated chain is highly desirable. The current stop-start nature is jarring.
    *   **Clarity & Transparency:** How will the user understand what's happening in the background during a longer chain? Is there a risk of it feeling like a "black box"?
    *   **Error Handling:** What happens if the chain breaks? How does the user recover? A brittle process, even if automated, leads to poor UX.
    *   **Intermediate Artifacts:** The request questions their necessity. From a PO perspective, these artifacts often represent valuable validation points and ensure shared understanding. Removing them entirely might be efficient but could compromise the quality and buy-in of the final outputs. Can we make them optional or generate summaries instead?
3.  **Generalization vs. Specificity:** How does the generalized process ensure the right questions are asked for *any* given concept? The current prompts are specific to the MVP. A generalized version needs a mechanism (likely within the initial prompt or orchestrator) to tailor the analysis and discussion.
4.  **Output Goal (`requirements.md`, `roadmap.md`):** This is the ideal outcome. However, are these *always* the right outputs for *any* concept? A generalized process might need flexibility in its final deliverables.
5.  **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this Meta-Concept:** What's the simplest version of this chained workflow we could build first? Perhaps a fixed chain for a specific type of concept, focusing solely on UX improvement before tackling full generalization?
6.  **Success Metrics:** How would we measure the success of this new process? Reduced time to completion? User satisfaction (less friction)? Quality of generated requirements/roadmap (compared to the manual/monolithic process)?

**User Flow / Journey (Conceptual):**

1.  User inputs a `Concept` into the chat.
2.  AI Assistant (running the Orchestrator Prompt) confirms understanding and initiates the MotM chain.
3.  Assistant provides brief updates on progress (e.g., "Simulating SME analysis..."; "Synthesizing discussion...") without requiring explicit continuation prompts.
4.  *Potential Checkpoint:* Assistant presents a summary of Round 1 findings for optional user review/steer.
5.  Chain continues through subsequent rounds/steps.
6.  Assistant delivers final `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md` files.
7.  *Error Scenario:* Assistant reports an issue and suggests options (e.g., "Retry last step?", "Provide more information?", "Abort?").

**Key Question:** Can we design a chained workflow that balances the desire for automation and reduced UX friction with the need for robustness, transparency, and potentially necessary checkpoints to ensure the quality and relevance of the final `requirements.md` and `roadmap.md` outputs for a *generalized* concept?

# Product Owner Pre-Analysis

## Initial Thoughts on MCP for Prompt Servers in Cursor IDE

### User Value
- The MCP should deliver a seamless, low-friction coding assistant experience within Cursor IDE, minimizing manual steps (no copy/paste).
- Key value: reliable code Q&A and safe code insertion with user preview/confirmation.
- User trust is paramountâ€”clear feedback, undo, and error handling are essential.

### MVP Scope
- Focus on core workflows: reading files, answering questions, and inserting code snippets with confirmation.
- Defer advanced features (multi-file, multi-agent, advanced RAG) to post-MVP.
- Ensure robust error handling and clear user messaging from the start.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All MVP requirements and acceptance criteria (REQs, ACs) must be met.
- User must be able to:
  - Ask questions about the active file and get accurate answers.
  - Preview and confirm code insertions before changes are made.
  - Receive clear feedback on success/failure of actions.
- Setup and usage must be well-documented and easy to follow.

### Business Risks
- Poor UX (e.g., copy/paste, unclear errors) could undermine adoption.
- Security lapses (file access, API key handling) could create liability.
- Incomplete or unreliable tool behavior could erode user trust.

### Open Questions
- What metrics will best capture user satisfaction and agent reliability?
- How to prioritize feedback and iterate quickly post-MVP?
- Are there regulatory or compliance considerations for code modification features?
