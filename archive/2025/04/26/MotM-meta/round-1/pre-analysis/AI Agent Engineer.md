# AI Agent Engineer - Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-04-26

**Concept Analyzed:** Refactoring the MotM workflow into a generalized chain of (potentially) agent-like prompts within Cursor AI, aiming for automation and direct output generation.

**Prerequisites Reviewed:** Existing MotM prompts, MVP requirements/roadmap.

**Initial Thoughts & Analysis:**

1.  **Agent Framework Analogy:** The concept leans towards simulating a multi-agent system within the chat interface. Each "step" in the chain can be viewed as an agent with a specific role (e.g., `AnalysisAgent`, `SynthesisAgent`, `RequirementWriterAgent`). The "Orchestrator Prompt" acts as the central controller or dispatcher.
2.  **Agent Design (Prompt-Based):** Each agent would be defined by a prompt that includes:
    *   **Role & Goal:** Clear definition of its task.
    *   **Input Specification:** What state/data does it expect (from the state file)?
    *   **Tool Usage:** Instructions on using tools (read file, write file).
    *   **Output Specification:** What should it produce, and how should it update the state file for the next agent?
3.  **Orchestration:** The meta-prompt/orchestrator is key. Its responsibilities:
    *   Initialize the process.
    *   Parse the initial concept.
    *   Manage the state file (read/write access).
    *   Determine the sequence of agents (fixed or dynamic).
    *   Invoke the next agent/prompt in the chain.
    *   Handle potential errors reported by agents or tools.
    *   Terminate the process and synthesize final outputs.
4.  **State Management:** As others noted, file-based state is the likely mechanism. From an agent perspective:
    *   **Standardization:** A consistent state schema (`JSON` preferred over `.md` for machine readability, though harder for user debugging) is crucial for agents to reliably parse inputs and write outputs.
    *   **State Granularity:** What information needs to persist? Concept details, intermediate findings, decisions, list of completed steps, error flags?
5.  **Communication:** Agents communicate indirectly via the state file managed by the orchestrator. There's no direct agent-to-agent interaction.
6.  **Tool Dependency:** The entire system is highly dependent on the reliable functioning of `read_file` and `edit_file` tools. Tool failures are system failures.
7.  **Generalization & Adaptability:** For agents to handle generalized concepts, their prompts need to be written to extract relevant information from the concept description and adapt their analysis accordingly. This might involve few-shot examples within the prompt or specific instructions on how to query the concept data stored in the state.
8.  **Limitations:** This is a *simulation* of an agent system. We lack true agent autonomy, robust error handling, complex memory, or parallel execution capabilities inherent in dedicated agent frameworks.

**Conceptual Agent Flow:**

    participant User
    participant Orchestrator (Meta-Prompt)
    participant StateFile
    participant Agent1 (e.g., Analyst)
    participant Agent2 (e.g., Synthesizer)

    User->>Orchestrator: /motm <concept>
    Orchestrator->>StateFile: Initialize state.md (concept)
    Orchestrator->>Agent1: Invoke(Read state.md)
    Agent1->>StateFile: Read state
    Note over Agent1: Perform Analysis Task
    Agent1->>StateFile: Write results, update state
    Agent1->>Orchestrator: Report Completion/Status

    Orchestrator->>Agent2: Invoke(Read state.md)
    Agent2->>StateFile: Read state
    Note over Agent2: Perform Synthesis Task
    Agent2->>StateFile: Write final outputs, update state
    Agent2->>Orchestrator: Report Completion/Status

    Orchestrator->>User: Provide final files
```

**Key Question:** How can we design the individual agent prompts and the central orchestrator prompt to create a pseudo-agentic workflow that is robust enough to handle the sequential, state-dependent execution entirely through file I/O and prompt instructions, while allowing for the necessary generalization to handle varied concepts?
