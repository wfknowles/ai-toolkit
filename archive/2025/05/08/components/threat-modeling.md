# Threat Modeling Template & Guidelines for AI Integration Points - v1.0

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a template and guidelines for conducting and documenting threat models for systems and workflows involving the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), within Our Project. Consistent threat modeling helps us proactively identify, assess, and mitigate security and privacy risks associated with these integrations.

Threat modeling should be performed during the design phase of new AI integrations and reviewed periodically or whenever significant changes occur to the system, its data flows, or the underlying AI models/providers.

## 2. Threat Modeling Process Overview

We recommend following these general steps:

1.  **Define Scope:** Clearly delineate the boundaries of the system or process being modeled.
2.  **Decompose the System:** Create a diagram (e.g., Data Flow Diagram - DFD) showing key components, data stores, processes, external interactors (users, other systems, LLM APIs), trust boundaries, and data flows.
3.  **Identify Assets:** List the critical assets within the scope that need protection (e.g., sensitive data, API keys, model integrity, service availability).
4.  **Identify Threats:** Systematically identify potential threats using a recognized methodology (STRIDE is recommended). Consider threats specific to AI/ML systems.
5.  **Analyze Vulnerabilities & Controls:** For each threat, identify potential vulnerabilities that enable it and evaluate existing or planned security controls.
6.  **Assess Risk:** Prioritize threats based on likelihood and potential impact (e.g., using DREAD or a simple High/Medium/Low scale).
7.  **Recommend Mitigations:** Define specific, actionable mitigation strategies for high-priority risks.
8.  **Document & Review:** Document the findings clearly and review them with relevant stakeholders (Security, Dev, Product).
9.  **Iterate:** Treat the threat model as a living document, revisiting it as the system evolves.

## 3. Threat Model Document Template

Use the following sections to structure each threat model document. Store these documents in a designated, version-controlled location (e.g., a `security/threat_models/` directory within the relevant project repository).

### Threat Model: [Name of System/Process Being Modeled]

**Version:** [e.g., 1.0]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Authors/Contributors:** [List of names/roles]
**Reviewers:** [List of names/roles]
**Last Review Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**1. System Overview and Scope:**
    *   Brief description of the system/process being modeled.
    *   What are the primary goals or use cases?
    *   Clearly define what is IN scope and what is OUT of scope for this model.

**2. System Decomposition:**
    *   **Diagram(s):** Include Data Flow Diagram(s) (DFD) or architectural diagrams. Clearly label components, data stores, processes, external entities, trust boundaries (e.g., user browser, IDE plugin, local backend service, third-party LLM API, company internal network), and data flows.
    *   **Component Descriptions:** Briefly describe each key component shown in the diagram and its function.
    *   **Data Flow Descriptions:** Describe the data being exchanged in key data flows, noting any sensitive data types.

**3. Asset Identification:**
    *   List the critical assets within the scope.
    *   For each asset, briefly describe why it's important and what security properties need protection (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
    *   *Example:*
        *   *Asset:* LLM API Key (e.g., OpenAI Key used by backend service)
        *   *Protection Needed:* Confidentiality, Integrity (prevent unauthorized use)
        *   *Asset:* User-provided context data
        *   *Protection Needed:* Confidentiality (if sensitive), Integrity
        *   *Asset:* Prompt Templates in Library
        *   *Protection Needed:* Integrity (prevent malicious modification), Availability
        *   *Asset:* Generated Code Output
        *   *Protection Needed:* Integrity, Confidentiality (if proprietary logic)

**4. Threat Elicitation (using STRIDE):**

Apply the STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to each relevant element of the system diagram (processes, data flows, data stores, external entities). Consider AI-specific threats alongside standard ones.

*   **Spoofing:**
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate user to the IDE plugin or backend service?
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker impersonate the backend service to the IDE plugin?
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker impersonate the backend service to the LLM API provider (e.g., using stolen keys)?
*   **Tampering:**
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker modify prompt templates in transit or storage?
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker modify context data sent from the IDE to the backend? (Prompt Injection input)
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker modify the prompt sent from the backend to the LLM API?
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker modify the response (e.g., generated code) coming back from the LLM?
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker tamper with the AI model itself (Data Poisoning - if applicable)?
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker tamper with audit logs?
*   **Repudiation:**
    *   *Threat:* Can a user deny sending a specific prompt request?
    *   *Threat:* Can the backend service deny having served a specific prompt? (Addressed by logging - Component #14)
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker intercept sensitive context data sent to the backend or LLM API?
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker intercept LLM API keys?
    *   *Threat:* Can prompts be crafted to leak sensitive information from the LLM's training data (Model Inversion/Extraction)?
    *   *Threat:* Can prompts leak sensitive information present in their own context window if handled improperly by the LLM or logged insecurely?
    *   *Threat:* Can error messages leak sensitive internal system details?
    *   *Threat:* Can audit logs be accessed inappropriately?
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   *Threat:* Can the backend service be overwhelmed with requests?
    *   *Threat:* Can malformed requests crash the backend service?
    *   *Threat:* Can prompts be crafted to cause excessive resource consumption by the LLM (leading to high costs or slow responses)?
    *   *Threat:* Can access to the prompt library or LLM API be disrupted?
*   **Elevation of Privilege:**
    *   *Threat:* Can a user leverage the prompt system to execute actions beyond their permissions (e.g., crafting a prompt that generates code to access restricted resources)? (Requires careful output validation).
    *   *Threat:* Can an attacker compromise the backend service and gain elevated privileges on the host or network?
    *   *Threat:* Can prompt injection lead to the LLM performing unauthorized actions if it has agency or interacts with other tools?

**5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan:**

For each identified threat scenario (or group related threats), document:

| Threat ID | Scenario Description | STRIDE Category | Target Asset(s) | Potential Vulnerability(s) | Existing Controls | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Impact (H/M/L) | Risk Level (H/M/L) | Proposed Mitigation(s) | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T001 | Attacker intercepts context data sent from IDE plugin to local backend service | Information Disclosure | User context data | Unencrypted HTTP connection locally; Lack of mutual TLS (mTLS) if backend exposed | None / Assumed Localhost | L (if strictly localhost) / M (if exposed) | M (if context sensitive) | L/M | Ensure backend binds only to 127.0.0.1; Consider using HTTPS even for localhost if feasible/necessary; Sanitize sensitive data client-side before sending. | Dev Team | Planned |
| T002 | Malicious user crafts input to IDE plugin causing prompt injection in backend, leading LLM to ignore instructions and reveal system prompt or execute harmful instructions. | Tampering / Elevation of Privilege | Prompt Integrity / System Security | Backend service does not properly sanitize or demarcate user input within the final prompt sent to LLM. | Basic input validation (current) | M | H | H | Implement strict input demarcation in prompts (Standard #5); Use specific LLM settings/prompts designed to prevent instruction following on user input; Validate LLM output for suspicious patterns. | Prompt Team / Sec Team | In Progress |
| T003 | LLM API Key hardcoded in backend service code and committed to Git. | Information Disclosure | LLM API Key | Improper secrets management | None | H (if committed) | H | H | Remove key from code; Store key in secure secrets manager; Use secure methods (IAM role, env var injection in secure runner) to provide key to service at runtime; Implement secrets scanning in CI (Component #7). | DevOps / Sec Team | Implemented |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


**6. Review and Sign-off:**
    *   Record of review dates and attendees.
    *   Sign-off indicating acceptance of residual risks or agreement on mitigation plan.

## 4. Guidelines for AI/ML Specific Threats

When applying STRIDE, pay special attention to threats common to AI/ML systems:

*   **Prompt Injection:** Manipulating LLM inputs to bypass instructions or cause unintended actions. (Tampering/EoP)
*   **Data Poisoning:** Maliciously altering training data to compromise model behavior. (Tampering - More relevant if training models internally)
*   **Model Evasion/Adversarial Attacks:** Crafting inputs designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions or classifications. (Tampering/DoS)
*   **Model Inversion/Extraction:** Querying a model to infer sensitive information about its training data or extract the model itself. (Information Disclosure)
*   **Membership Inference:** Determining if a specific data record was part of the model's training set. (Information Disclosure)
*   **Unfairness/Bias Amplification:** Models perpetuating or amplifying existing societal biases present in training data. (Integrity/Ethical)

Consider how these apply to your specific use case and LLM interaction points.
