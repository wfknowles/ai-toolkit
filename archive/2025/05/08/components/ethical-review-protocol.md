# Ethical AI Usage and Review Protocol - v1.0

## 1. Purpose and Principles

This document establishes the protocol for ensuring that the development, deployment, and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into Our Project's workflows and potential products, adhere to established ethical principles and responsible practices.

The purpose is to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential ethical risks associated with AI usage, including bias, fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, security, and societal impact. This protocol operationalizes the ethical considerations outlined in the `Prompt Engineering Standards` (Standard #9) and complements existing security and data governance policies.

**Core Ethical Principles (Aligned with Company Values - *Customize these*):**
*   **Fairness:** Strive to ensure AI systems do not create or perpetuate unfair bias against individuals or groups.
*   **Accountability & Human Oversight:** Maintain human accountability for AI system development and outcomes. Ensure meaningful human oversight where appropriate.
*   **Transparency & Explainability:** Be transparent about the use of AI systems and strive for explainability in their operations and outputs where feasible and necessary.
*   **Security & Robustness:** Ensure AI systems are secure, reliable, and perform as intended, guarding against misuse or unintended consequences.
*   **Privacy:** Respect user privacy and handle data used by or generated by AI systems according to strict data protection principles.
*   **Beneficence & Non-Maleficence:** Aim for AI applications that benefit users and society, while actively working to avoid harm.

## 2. Scope

This protocol applies to:
*   The design and use of prompts and prompt chains within the `Centralized Prompt Library` that interact with LLMs or other generative AI.
*   The integration of AI models (internal or third-party) into internal development tools (e.g., the `IDE Integration Plugin`).
*   The potential incorporation of AI-generated content or AI-driven features into Our Project's end products or services.
*   The use of datasets for training or fine-tuning AI models used within the project scope.

## 3. Ethical Risk Assessment Framework

Before deploying a new AI application, feature, or significantly novel prompt use case, an ethical risk assessment must be conducted. The level of scrutiny depends on the potential impact.

**Risk Levels (Illustrative):**

*   **Level 1 (Low Risk):** AI use with minimal external impact, primarily internal efficiency tools generating non-sensitive, easily verifiable content (e.g., generating unit test boilerplate for internal code, summarizing internal technical documents).
    *   *Assessment:* Self-assessment by developer using a basic checklist based on Section 5. Requires adherence to standard Prompt Engineering and Security guidelines.
*   **Level 2 (Medium Risk):** AI use generating content for broader internal audiences, significantly impacting developer workflows, potentially handling moderately sensitive internal data, or generating creative content that *could* reflect biases (e.g., generating internal documentation drafts, complex code refactoring suggestions, generating diverse synthetic data for testing).
    *   *Assessment:* Requires review by at least one designated peer reviewer or the `AI Systems Integration & Security Auditor (SISA)` using a more detailed checklist. Focus on bias, transparency, and data handling.
*   **Level 3 (High Risk):** AI use generating content directly for external users/customers, making decisions that significantly impact users or the business, handling sensitive PII/financial data, operating in regulated domains, or having high potential for generating harmful/biased content (e.g., AI-powered customer support responses, AI-driven feature recommendations, code generation for critical production systems, analysis of sensitive user data).
    *   *Assessment:* Requires formal review and approval by a designated AI Ethics Committee or panel (including representation from SISA, Legal, relevant Product owner, potentially external expert). Requires in-depth analysis using the full protocol.

**Assessment Factors:**
*   **Use Case Domain:** (e.g., healthcare, finance are higher risk)
*   **Data Sensitivity:** (PII, financial, proprietary IP)
*   **Impact on Users/Decisions:** (Direct customer interaction, decision automation)
*   **Autonomy Level:** (Fully automated vs. human-in-the-loop)
*   **Potential for Bias/Harm:** (Based on task and data)
*   **Regulatory Context:** (e.g., GDPR, AI Act)

## 4. Review Process for Medium/High-Risk Applications

1.  **Initiation:** Developer/Team identifies a potential Medium/High-Risk AI application or prompt use case.
2.  **Documentation:** Developer/Team completes an "AI Ethical Impact Assessment" document, addressing the points in Section 5.
3.  **Submission:** Submit the assessment document for review via a designated process (e.g., internal ticketing system, dedicated review board).
4.  **Review:** The designated reviewer(s) or Ethics Committee assesses the documentation, potentially requests clarifications or further analysis, and evaluates against the Core Ethical Principles.
5.  **Decision & Mitigation:**
    *   **Approve:** Application deemed ethically acceptable as designed.
    *   **Approve with Conditions:** Approval granted contingent upon implementing specific mitigation strategies (e.g., adding specific bias checks, enhancing transparency notices, implementing stronger human oversight).
    *   **Reject/Request Revision:** Application deemed ethically unacceptable in its current form; requires significant redesign or abandonment.
6.  **Documentation:** The review decision, rationale, and any required mitigations are documented and tracked.

## 5. Ethical Impact Assessment Checklist (Core Elements)

This checklist forms the basis for assessment (expand based on risk level):

*   **[ ] Purpose & Benefit:** What is the intended purpose and benefit of this AI application? Does it align with company values?
*   **[ ] Data Usage:** What data does the AI process (input, training)? Is it sensitive? Is data handling compliant with privacy policies and regulations? Has data minimization been applied?
*   **[ ] Fairness & Bias:**
    *   What are the potential sources of bias (data, algorithm, prompt design)?
    *   How will bias be measured and monitored?
    *   What steps are being taken to mitigate identified biases (e.g., diverse data sourcing, prompt constraints, output filtering)?
    *   Does the application risk creating or reinforcing unfair outcomes for any user group?
*   **[ ] Transparency & Explainability:**
    *   Will users (internal or external) be aware they are interacting with an AI or AI-generated content?
    *   How understandable are the AI's outputs or decisions? Is a higher level of explainability needed for this use case?
    *   How will the role and limitations of the AI be communicated?
*   **[ ] Accountability & Human Oversight:**
    *   Who is accountable for the AI system's development, deployment, and outcomes?
    *   What level of human oversight, review, or intervention is planned? Is it sufficient for the risk level?
    *   Is there a mechanism for users to appeal or seek recourse from AI-driven decisions or outputs?
*   **[ ] Security & Robustness:**
    *   Have AI-specific security risks (prompt injection, data leakage via prompts, adversarial attacks) been assessed and mitigated? (Ref: Component #9 Threat Model)
    *   How will the system behave under unexpected inputs or edge cases?
*   **[ ] Privacy:** (Covered under Data Usage, but reiterate) Are user privacy expectations being met? Are privacy-enhancing techniques used where appropriate?
*   **[ ] Potential Negative Impacts:** Has consideration been given to potential unintended negative consequences or misuse of the AI application?

## 6. Bias Detection and Mitigation Guidance

*   **Data Analysis:** Analyze training and input datasets for known demographic biases or underrepresentation. Use statistical bias detection tools where applicable.
*   **Prompt Design (Ref: Standard #9):** Craft prompts to explicitly request fairness, diversity, and avoidance of stereotypes. Test prompts with diverse inputs to uncover biased outputs.
*   **Model Selection/Fine-Tuning:** Prefer models known for better performance on fairness benchmarks, if applicable. Consider fine-tuning techniques aimed at reducing bias.
*   **Output Filtering/Post-processing:** Implement checks or filters on AI outputs to detect and potentially block or flag biased or harmful content (use with caution to avoid over-censorship).
*   **Regular Testing:** Continuously test the AI system with diverse scenarios and user groups to monitor for emergent biases over time.

## 7. Requirements for Transparency and Explainability

*   **Disclosure:** Be transparent about the use of AI where it significantly interacts with or impacts users. Provide clear notices (e.g., "This response was generated with AI assistance").
*   **Explainability:** For high-risk or decision-making applications, strive to provide explanations for AI outputs where technically feasible. This might involve using inherently more interpretable models, employing XAI techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP), or designing the system to clearly show the inputs and steps leading to a result. The level of required explainability depends heavily on the context.
*   **Documentation:** Document the AI system's capabilities, limitations, and intended use clearly for both internal teams and potentially external users.

## 8. Protocol Review and Updates

This protocol, including the risk assessment framework and checklist, must be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently in response to:
*   Significant changes in AI technology or capabilities.
*   Emergence of new ethical concerns or best practices.
*   Changes in relevant laws and regulations (e.g., AI Act).
*   Lessons learned from internal reviews or incidents.

Updates should be approved by the AI Ethics Committee or equivalent governing body.
