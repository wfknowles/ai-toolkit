# Prompt Engineer - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial concepts focusing on prompts as tools for agents or users, leveraging quantitative analysis and financial formulas.*

1.  **Metric Explanation Prompt Tool:** Design a prompt template an agent can use. Input: [Metric Name (e.g., DTI)], [Metric Value (e.g., 29.1%)], [User Context (e.g., $5670/mo income, goal: reduce debt)]. Output: Simple, clear explanation of the metric and its relevance to the user's situation.
2.  **Data Extraction Prompt Tool:** Prompt for extracting specific numeric values from user's natural language input (e.g., User says "My mortgage is around twelve hundred fifty", Prompt extracts "1250"). Requires robust handling of fuzzy language.
3.  **Goal Feasibility Check Prompt Tool:** Prompt template. Input: [Goal Amount], [Goal Deadline], [Calculated Monthly Disposable Income]. Output: LLM assesses feasibility and generates text like "Saving $[Goal Amount] by [Deadline] requires saving $[Required Rate]/month. Based on your current disposable income of $[DI], this looks [feasible/challenging/very difficult]. Would you like to explore budget adjustments?"
4.  **Budget Adjustment Suggestion Prompt Tool:** Prompt template. Input: [Savings Shortfall Amount], [User Spending Data (by category)], [Expert Config (priority areas)]. Output: Suggests specific, actionable budget cuts or reallocations (e.g., "Reducing [Category X] by $[Amount] could close the savings gap."), aligned with expert strategy.
5.  **Spending Anomaly Explanation Prompt Tool:** Prompt template. Input: [Category], [Spending Amount], [Historical Average], [Standard Deviation]. Output: Explains *why* current spending is flagged (e.g., "Your $[Amount] spending on [Category] this week is significantly higher than your usual average of $[Avg] Â± $[StdDev].").
6.  **Subscription Review Prompt Tool:** Prompt to analyze linked account transactions (Plaid data context) for recurring subscription-like payments. Input: [Time Period]. Output: List of potential subscriptions with vendor/amount, prompting user: "I found these potential recurring payments. Are these all active subscriptions you want to keep?"
7.  **"Pay Yourself First" Prompt Tool:** Recurring prompt (timing configurable by expert). Output: "Reminder: Based on your $2600 paycheck, your goal is to transfer $[Configured Amount/Percent] to savings. Have you made the transfer?"
8.  **Debt Payoff Simulation Prompt Tool:** Prompt template. Input: [Debt List (Balances, Rates, Mins)], [Payoff Strategy (Snowball/Avalanche - expert config?)], [Extra Payment Amount]. Output: Explanation of the chosen strategy and projected payoff timeline/interest saved for the selected debt.
9.  **Agent Action Confirmation Prompt Tool:** Before an agent takes a potentially significant *action* (if ever allowed beyond suggestions), use a prompt to clearly explain the intended action and request explicit user confirmation.
