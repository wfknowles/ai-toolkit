# AI Agent Engineer - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial concepts focusing on agent capabilities leveraging financial formulas, analyses, and prompt tools.*

1.  **Metric Monitoring Agent:** Agent periodically triggers calculation service for key metrics (Savings Rate, DTI, Budget Variance). If metrics cross expert-configured thresholds or change significantly, it logs event or triggers notification agent.
2.  **Statistical Anomaly Detection Agent:** Agent runs calculation (`Mean + X*StdDev`) on spending categories periodically (e.g., weekly). Flags anomalies and potentially triggers PE explanation prompt tool for user notification.
3.  **Subscription Audit Agent:** Agent periodically runs PE Subscription Review Prompt Tool on recent transactions, presents potential subscriptions to user for confirmation/cancellation reminder.
4.  **Goal Progress Monitoring Agent:** Agent calculates `Required Monthly Savings` (from Goal Calculator Tool) vs `Actual Monthly Savings` (from Savings Rate Tool). Triggers notifications or suggestions (via PE prompt tools) if progress is off track based on expert config.
5.  **Tool Execution Agent:** A central agent capability that receives user requests (via UX interaction model) for specific tools (e.g., "Explain DTI", "Simulate Debt Payoff"), gathers necessary inputs, triggers the relevant PE prompt tool or calculation service, and formats the response.
6.  **Data Quality Agent:** Monitors for low-confidence categorizations or missing essential data (fixed costs, debts). Prompts user (via UX) to review/update information needed for accurate analysis.
7.  **"Pay Yourself First" Agent:** Simple scheduled agent triggering the PE reminder prompt based on user's payday cycle (derived from $2600 bi-weekly input).
8.  **Agent Parameterization:** Agents' behavior (monitoring frequency, anomaly sensitivity `X`, notification rules) must be driven by parameters stored in the expert configuration (`ClientConfiguration` service).
9.  **Agent Observability:** Implement logging for agent actions, triggers, and tool usage to allow monitoring and debugging of agent behavior.
