# Financial Counselor - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial concepts focusing on using quantitative data empathetically and linking formulas/analyses to behavioral change.*

1.  **Framing Metrics Positively:** Use prompts/UX to frame metrics like Savings Rate or DTI progress constructively, focusing on improvement and achievable next steps, not judgment.
2.  **Linking Variance Analysis to Habits:** Don't just show budget variance ($ amount). Use AI/prompts to explore *why* variance occurred (e.g., "Spending in 'Dining Out' was $Y over budget. Was this a one-off event or a regular pattern? Let's explore...").
3.  **Values-Based Goal Setting:** Use initial prompts to explore user's core values *before* setting quantitative goals. Ensure calculated Required Savings Rate aligns with goals reflecting those values.
4.  **Small Wins Tracker:** Formula/Analysis: Track frequency of positive financial actions (e.g., staying under budget in a category, making an extra debt payment, hitting a small savings milestone). Use for positive reinforcement.
5.  **Spending Trigger Analysis (Qualitative + Quantitative):** Combine Plaid data with user journaling (prompted). Agent prompt: "You mentioned feeling stressed when your spending on [Category] increased. Can we look at the transactions around [Date] and see if there were specific triggers?"
6.  **Emergency Fund Goal Setting:** Use the formula (`Savings / Monthly Essential Expenses`) to calculate current coverage. Frame the 3-6 month target as a buffer against specific anxieties (job loss, unexpected bill).
7.  **Non-Judgmental Debt Exploration:** Use prompts that gently encourage user to input debt details (if missing), emphasizing benefit (clearer picture, payoff simulation) without pressure.
8.  **Agent Prompt: "Reflect on Spending":** Agent tool prompt: "Let's look at your spending in [Discretionary Category] last month ($X). How do you feel about that amount in relation to your goal of [Goal Name]?"
9.  **Integrating Expert Configuration (Empathy):** Ensure expert config allows setting AI tone to be empathetic, and allows configuring how *directly* the AI presents potentially negative quantitative analysis (e.g., high DTI).
