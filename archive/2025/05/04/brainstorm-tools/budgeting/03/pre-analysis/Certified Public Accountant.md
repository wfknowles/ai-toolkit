# Certified Public Accountant - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial concepts focusing on relevant formulas, analyses, and data accuracy from an accounting perspective.*

1.  **Net Worth Calculation:** Formula: `Total Assets - Total Liabilities`. Requires user input/linking for assets (bank accounts, savings, investments, property value?) and liabilities (debts, mortgage balance). AI can automate calculation.
2.  **Cash Flow Statement (Simplified):** Analysis tracking `Cash Inflows (Income) - Cash Outflows (Expenses + Debt Payments + Savings Transfers) = Net Cash Flow` over a period (monthly/quarterly). Requires accurate categorization of Plaid data.
3.  **Budget vs. Actual Reporting:** Formal analysis comparing budgeted amounts (Concept 5) vs. actual spending (Concept 6) per category, showing variance. Essential for control.
4.  **Importance of Gross vs. Net Income:** Emphasize need for Gross Income for standard DTI calculation. If only Net ($2600) is available, document the estimation method used for Gross and the limitation of the resulting DTI.
5.  **Accurate Expense Categorization:** Stress the need for reliable categorization (Plaid + user review) to make analyses like Budget vs. Actual meaningful. Suggest standard chart of accounts adaptable for personal finance.
6.  **Debt Analysis (Beyond DTI):** Formulas/Analysis: Calculate `Total Debt Balance`, `Weighted Average Interest Rate` (if rates known), simulate payoff timelines (Snowball/Avalanche). Requires detailed debt inputs.
7.  **Emergency Fund Adequacy:** Formula: `Liquid Savings Balance / Average Monthly Essential Expenses`. Target is typically 3-6 months. Requires identifying essential vs. discretionary spending categories.
8.  **Savings Rate Verification:** Ensure Savings Rate calculation (Concept 3) accurately captures intended savings (transfers to savings/investment accounts) vs. just unspent cash building in checking.
9.  **Data Input Validation:** Recommend input validation checks for user-provided data (e.g., ensuring debt payments don't exceed balances, basic sanity checks on figures).
