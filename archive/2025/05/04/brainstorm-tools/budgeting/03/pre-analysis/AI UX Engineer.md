# AI UX Engineer - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial concepts focusing on the user experience of interacting with quantitative analyses and agent tools.*

1.  **Visualize Key Metrics Simply:** Design clear, minimalist components (gauge charts for DTI, simple number display + trend indicator for Savings Rate, bar charts for Budget Variance) for displaying core quantitative outputs.
2.  **Contextual Explainability:** Provide easy access to explanations for metrics. E.g., Tapping on the DTI gauge reveals a simple explanation generated by the Metric Explanation Prompt Tool.
3.  **Progressive Disclosure for Data Input:** Design onboarding/settings flows that ask for minimal data initially (income), then contextually prompt for fixed costs/debts when needed for specific calculations (Disposable Income, DTI).
4.  **Presenting Anomalies Clearly:** Design the UI for flagged spending anomalies. Show the flagged transaction/period, the historical average/range, and provide clear options for user feedback ("This was unusual", "Ignore", "Update budget").
5.  **Interactive Projections/Simulations:** Design interfaces for goal setting (Required Savings Rate) and debt payoff simulations that allow users to adjust inputs (e.g., extra payment amount) and see the impact update visually.
6.  **Agent Interaction Model:** Design how users invoke agent tools. Via chat interface? Dedicated buttons ("Analyze Spending", "Explain DTI")? Ensure low friction.
7.  **Communicating Calculation Caveats:** Design UI text or tooltips to clearly communicate assumptions or limitations (e.g., "DTI calculated using estimated gross income", "Savings Rate based on tagged accounts").
8.  **Dashboard for Quantitative Overview:** Design a dashboard view that surfaces the most critical quantitative metrics (Disposable Income, Savings Rate, Budget Summary/Variance, upcoming income/bills) in one place.
9.  **Low-Confidence Categorization Review:** Design an efficient UI flow for users to review transactions flagged with low categorization confidence, making correction easy to improve data quality.
