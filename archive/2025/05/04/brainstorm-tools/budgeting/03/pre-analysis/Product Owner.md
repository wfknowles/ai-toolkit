# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial concepts focusing on product value and feature prioritization for quantitative analyses and agent tools.*

1.  **MVP Feature: Core Metrics Calculation & Display:** Prioritize the calculation and simple display (no complex charts yet) of MVP metrics: Disposable Income, Savings Rate, DTI (with caveats), Budget Variance. Value: Gives user immediate quantitative baseline.
2.  **Feature: Interactive Goal Setting w/ Feasibility:** Allow users to set goals (Amount/Date) and see the calculated *Required Monthly Savings* based on their income/budget. Value: Makes goals concrete and actionable.
3.  **Feature: Spending Anomaly Review:** Implement the statistical anomaly detection and present flagged spending clearly to the user for review. Value: Proactive insight beyond simple budget tracking.
4.  **Feature: Cash Flow Calendar/View:** Simple visual showing upcoming income ($2600 paychecks) and known large bill due dates (from user input). Value: Helps user anticipate potential shortfalls.
5.  **Feature: Agent Tool - "Explain This Metric":** Allow users to ask the agent (via chat/button) to explain a displayed metric (DTI, Savings Rate), triggering the Metric Explanation Prompt Tool. Value: Improves financial literacy and understanding.
6.  **Feature: Agent Tool - "Analyze Category Spending":** User can ask agent to analyze spending in a specific category over time (e.g., "Show my grocery spending trend for 3 months"). Value: On-demand deeper dive.
7.  **Prioritize Data Quality:** Ensure high priority is given to features supporting accurate data - Plaid linking reliability, easy transaction categorization/correction flow, clear input for fixed costs/debts.
8.  **Phased Rollout of Formulas/Analyses:** MVP = Core metrics. Phase 2 = Anomaly detection, cash flow viz. Phase 3 = Projections, debt simulations. Avoid overwhelming user initially.
9.  **User Story Example (Agent Tool):** "As a user, I want to ask the AI assistant to calculate my savings rate for the last month, so that I can quickly see my progress without searching through reports."
