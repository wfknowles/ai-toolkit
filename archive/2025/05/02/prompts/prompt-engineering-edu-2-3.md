**Agent Instructions:** ***Do Not Output. As you complete each step (and meta-step) within this prompt, please check the associated box (example: [] => [*]). Verify each check mark after completing checking each step. Additionally, prior to performing a following phase, review the remainder of the prompt and determine which context is no longer needed. Once completed, please offload the context that is no longer needed. Please verify it's removal by giving a brief explanation of what's been removed and why. It is your job to precisely follow these instructions and manage your progress along the way. It is also your job to manage switching out the different persona. Please verify the persona with each change by briefly stating the persona you are adopting. ***

**Original Concept**
We just had a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review that discussion: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/sme-group-interview.md`. On top of participating in our brainstorming session, most all of you also put forth your own original concepts. Make yourselves familiar with everyone's initial concepts within here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`. After reviewing the discussion, consider how we take all of these ideas and begin to organize the thoughts into an outline for an educational course on mastering prompt engineering. Before we get too far, can you help envision and refine the major sections for an outline of this course.

**Background**
After reviewing the `Original Concept` and it's resulting analyses and discussions, review the initial outlines the SMEs have created for guiding this research phase: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-outlines`.Consider how we take all of these ideas and begin to organize the thoughts and then transition to the research phase. For each of the outlines created by the SMEs, we need to conduct adequate research and create a thesis quality exploration of all questions and answers per each outline.

**Curriculum:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/curriculum.md`

**Pre-Analysis:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-analysis`

**Pre-Interviews:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-interviews`

**Pre-Outlines:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-outlines`

**Facilitator Guidance**
We just completed round two of a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review the agreed upon `Curriculum` and the resulting `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, and `Pre-Outlines` from the preceding parts of this round. In this third part of the second round, we're going to work with Research Assistants to create research papers based on the outlines for pre-researching material needed in preparation of the next round's creation of final deliverables.

[] Meta Step 2: <your second step goes here>
[] Meta Step 3: <and so on, and so forth...>

### Phase 1 - Meta Analysis
[] Step 1: Analyze this prompt, it's `Background` and determine the best mix of personas to facilitate this rounds research phase for next rounds' group discussion on converting the `Original Concept` into a fully developed plan for researching and developing and educational course on the `Original Concept`. Please adopt the relevant persona to help facilitate the pre-research.

[] Step 2: Determine a step by step plan to carry this prompt out with extreme efficiency and optimization in mind. Consider slow is okay. Tolerance for errors is low, and my expectations of UX are very high. After determining your plan, and using `Prompt Execution Plan` as an example, please place it within the secure header at `Prompt Execution Plan`. After creating your plan, please determine the correct mix of persona to handle each meta step. Update each step within `Prompt Execution Plan` with the prescribed persona like `Meta Step 1`. 

### Phase 2 - Invitations & Analyzing Prerequisites

[] Step 1: Invite these experts to analyze our `Concept` and `Curriculum` for a another round planning for our refined group session where they'll marry the `Concept` and `Curriculum` with the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, and `Pre-Outlines`. Here are the persona to invite:
- Prompt Engineer
- AI Orchestrator/Architect
- Senior Software Engineer
- Project Manager
- AI UX Engineer
- AI Agent Engineer
- Educational UX Engineer
- AI Researcher

[] Step 2: Verify we are prepared for our session, please confirm our prepared directory `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-research/`.

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2, Part III

[] Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs outlines and research any topics you might need to prepare for working with a Professor of Research and multiple Research Assistants to generate and save this session's thesis-quality research papers.

### Phase 4 - Research & Compile Data

[] Step 1: To aid in the quality of the overall course, please take each SME's outline and then adopt the persona of a Research Assistant.

[] Step 2: Borrowing the perspective of a Professor of Education and Research, create a step by step plan to research all content specified in the individual SME's outline.

[] Step 3: Work through the research outline and plan and use all tools available to you. Search the web for academic papers, professional documentation, and other reputable resources to develop complete answers to the questions asked in the outline.

[] Step 4: Compile all research, examples, and relevant data. Organize your thoughts into a well-cited analysis and conversation that responds to all parts of the relevant SME outline.

[] Step 5: Save the complete thesis-quality research paper within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-research/` named `[persona-name].md`.
