**Concept**
We just had a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review that discussion: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/sme-group-interview.md`. On top of participating in our brainstorming session, most all of you also put forth your own original concepts. Make yourselves familiar with everyone's initial concepts within here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`. After reviewing the discussion, consider how we take all of these ideas and begin to organize the thoughts into an outline for an educational course on mastering prompt engineering. Before we get too far, can you help envision and refine the major sections for an outline of this course.

### Phase 1 - Meta Analysis
Step 1: Analyze this request and determine the best mix of personas to facilitate the below discussion on converting the `Concept` into a fully developed outline of an educational course on the `Concept`. Please adopt those persona at the appropriate step.

### Phase 2 - Invitations & Analyzing Prerequisites

Step 1: Invite these experts to analyze our `Concept`, and conduct a meeting to define our course outline. Here are the persona to invite:
- Prompt Engineer
- AI Orchestrator/Architect
- Senior Software Engineer
- Product Owner
- Project Manager
- AI UX Engineer
- AI Agent Engineer
- Pedagogy Researcher
- Educational UX Engineer
- Professor of Education
- AI Researcher

Step 2: In preparation for the full scope of planning and developing this educational content, please create a new `[output_dir]` subdirectory within `[output_root]`. Within the newly created `[output_root]/[output_dir]` directory, please create the following subdirectory `[output_subdir]`. We also need to prepare a place for our SME's pre-analysis, so within the newly created `[absolute_path]/` directory, please create the following subdirectory: `[absolute_path]/pre-analysis/`.

Step 3: Verify we are prepared for our session, please confirm our prepared directory `[absolute_path]`.

Step 2: Instruct all experts to please review the `Concept` and become familiar with it so that they might be prepared for a session where they'll help thoroughly review the `Concept` and then convert it into an outline for an educational course. Please have them each analyze the initial concept and then have them write or diagram out their inital thoughts, concerns, and/or feedback. Save their initial thoughts within `[absolute_path]/pre-analysis/` named `[persona-name].md`.

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 1

Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs analysis and research any topics you might need to prepare for an interview where you'll work through their initial outline and thoughts, and walk away with enough insight to plan the group interview phase of this session.

### Phase 4 - Individual Interviews

Step 1: Begin an interview with the individual SME and explore their pre-analysis. They need to be asked a series of questions utilizing your pre-planning:
- Do you see any inherent challenges to the converting the concept into educational content?
- Do you see any topics within the subject matter that might take more cognitive abilities or mental load, and which we might need to breakdown concepts into more easily digestable nuggets?
- When you learned about the `Concept`, how did you learn about it? What made you really grasp it's power? Was there anything that really unlocked new concepts for you or drove particular "Aha!" moments?
- Were there any unknown unknowns or blindspots that proved invaluable to your ability to grasp difficult to understand concepts?
- Work with them to help develop an overview and initial skeleton for an educational course of mastering the `Concept`.

### Phase 5 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2

Step 1: Carefully review each interview, and do a qualitative analysis and determine similarities, differences, semantic meanings, or critical areas for further discussion.

Step 2: Conduct any research necessary to help drive a meaningful and technical group discussion.

Step 3: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the many different insights and determine major talking points for the experts group analysis in the next step. If in the interviews you anticipate any potential disagreements or conflicts that will need to be specifically explored, please plan to navigate those situations.

Step 4: Plan out a thorough conversation between all SMEs where you walk them through your analysis and then work with them to determine the best curriculum for the given concept.

### Phase 6 - Meeting of the Minds

Step 1: Within a group of all experts, begin the conversation with the different persona and do an initial round of group analysis where everyone discusses what they see as the strengths and weaknesses of the different insights, strategies, and/or approaches.

Step 2: Begin another round of conversation between the different persona where everyone discusses what they see as specific challenges, difficulties, and/or unknown unknowns. Ensure everyone is being honest and rely on your interview to make sure the many perspectives are being heard and explored. It's a group of SMEs and we dont want any idea to be steamrolled.

Step 3: Begin another round of conversation between the different persona where everyone discusses what they see as the required high-level overview for a course that walks someone through the basics of the `Concept` all the way to a mastery understanding of it. Spend some time and really evaluate the neccessary modules and concepts that need to be planned out for a higher-level skeleton for our educational course. Discuss strategies for shedding light on any unknowns.

Step 4: Begin another round of conversation and have everyone then start adding flesh to the initial skeleton. Now that we have an understanding of the overall structure of the curriculum, we need to start defining the modules and concepts more fully, and then break those into more manageable milestones, phases, and/or assignments.

Step 5: Save the full output of the discussion here `[absolute_path]/` named `sme-group-interview.md`.

Step 6: Save the newly developed curriculum here `[absolute_path]/` named `curriculum.md`.

### Phase 3 - Create Requested Assets

Step 1: Please create a thesis quality research paper comprising the overall analysis and discussion. There should be sections for every major discussion point with detailed explorations of the each idea. There should be breakdowns of all major concepts and thorough discussion of comparisons, contrasts, tradeoffs. Please include commentary from the relevant expert and any code examples or diagrams that add clarity. For quality and depth sake, ensure its length reflects a deep exploration and analysis. More discussion is preferred to less.

Step 2: Save the full output of the discussion here `[absolute_path]/` named `analysis.md`.
