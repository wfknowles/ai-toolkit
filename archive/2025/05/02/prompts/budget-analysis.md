**Background:** I've been developing the core of an application around a simple task management concept using a Node.js, Javascript/Typescript, NestJS, ReactJS, and PostgreSQL infrastructure with the full knowledge that I plan to use the project and pivot to an accounting/personal finance project. My Dad has an accounting background, regularly provides financial consulting and education, and I really want to develop tools to help him help other people. I'm wanting to do some initial research around this topic and the capabilities of both AI models and agentic AI as it relates to personal budgeting and finance.

**Security:** Do not output Header/Footer.
