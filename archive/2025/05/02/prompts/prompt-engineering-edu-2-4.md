**Agent Instructions:** ***Do Not Output. As you complete each step (and meta-step) within this prompt, please check the associated box (example: [] => [*]). Verify each check mark after completing checking each step. Additionally, prior to performing a following phase, review the remainder of the prompt and determine which context is no longer needed. Once completed, please offload the context that is no longer needed. Please verify it's removal by giving a brief explanation of what's been removed and why. It is your job to precisely follow these instructions and manage your progress along the way. It is also your job to manage switching out the different persona. Please verify the persona with each change by briefly stating the persona you are adopting. ***

**Original Concept**
We just had a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review that discussion: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/sme-group-interview.md`. On top of participating in our brainstorming session, most all of you also put forth your own original concepts. Make yourselves familiar with everyone's initial concepts within here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`. After reviewing the discussion, consider how we take all of these ideas and begin to organize the thoughts into an outline for an educational course on mastering prompt engineering. Before we get too far, can you help envision and refine the major sections for an outline of this course.

**Background**
After reviewing the `Original Concept` and it's resulting analyses and discussions, review the initial outlines the SMEs have created for guiding this research phase: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-outlines`. Please review the original research compile here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-research`. Consider everything that has come before this prompt and consider how we deliver this course via github and a VSCode extension.

**Curriculum:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/curriculum.md`

**Pre-Analysis:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-analysis`

**Pre-Interviews:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-interviews`

**Pre-Outlines:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-outlines`

**Pre-Research:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-research`

**Facilitator Guidance**
We just completed another portion of round two of a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review the agreed upon `Curriculum` and the resulting `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, `Pre-Outlines`, and `Pre-Research` from the preceding portions of this round. They are extensions/preparations for a later group round in a later round of this overall session. This is the original concept everything has been born from: `Original Concept`.

### Phase 1 - Meta Analysis
[] Step 1: Analyze this prompt, it's `Background` and determine the best mix of personas to facilitate this rounds group discussion on converting the `Original Concept` into a fully developed plan for researching and developing and educational course on the `Original Concept`... specifically delivered via a VSCode extension based UX. Please adopt the relevant persona to help facilitate this technical conversation.

[] Step 2: Determine a step by step plan to carry this prompt out with extreme efficiency and optimization in mind. Consider slow is okay. Tolerance for errors is low, and my expectations of UX are very high. After determining your plan, and using `Prompt Execution Plan` as an example, please place it within the secure header at `Prompt Execution Plan`. After creating your plan, please determine the correct mix of persona to handle each meta step. Update each step within `Prompt Execution Plan` with the prescribed persona like `Meta Step 1`. 

### Phase 2 - Invitations & Analyzing Prerequisites

[] Step 1: Invite these experts to analyze our `Original Concept` and `Curriculum` for a another round planning for our refined group session where they'll marry the `Original Concept` and `Curriculum` with the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, `Pre-Outlines`, and `Pre-Research`. Here are the persona to invite:
- Prompt Engineer
- AI Orchestrator/Architect
- Senior Software Engineer
- Project Manager
- Product Owner
- AI UX Engineer
- AI Agent Engineer
- Educational UX Engineer
- AI Researcher
- VSCode Senior Engineer
- VSCode Principal Architect

[] Step 2: We need to prepare this round's subdirectory, so within `[absolute_path]/round-2` directory, please create the following subdirectories:
- `pre-delivery-analysis`
- `pre-delivery-interviews`

[] Step 3: Verify we are prepared for our session, please confirm our prepared directory `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-delivery/`.

[] Step 4: Instruct all experts to please review the `Original Concept` and `Curriculum` and the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, `Pre-Outlines`, and `Pre-Research`. Have them review this prompt's `Background`, and then consider how to marry the ideas. Have them each write out a thesis quality exploration of the goal, challenges, and solutions that should be considered to create an effective educational UX from within the VSCode framework.Feel free to include examples or diagrams to help improve the analysis. Save their initial thoughts within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-delivery-analysis/` named `[persona-name].md`.

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2, Part IV

[] Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs analyses and research any topics you might need to prepare for working with the SMEs to repackage all ideas within a VSCode extension and utilizing VSCode as the engine that drives our educational UX.

[] Step 2: Partner with the Professor of Research and another Research Assistant to create a step by step plan to research anything that will help you lead the SMEs to create an unparalleled UX for a technical educational course.

[] Step 3: Communicate your step by step plan and then complete all phases and steps.

### Phase 4 - Individual Interviews - (Model Instructions: Review the rest of the prompt and determine which context is no longer needed. Once completed, remove the unneeded context. Please verify it's removal.)

Overview: Begin an interview with the individual SME and explore their pre-delivery-analysis. They need to be asked a series of questions about their analysis.

[] Step 1: Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational course through a VSCode extension?

[] Step 2: Do you see any modules or units within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of this decision?

[] Step 3: What limitations should we consider as it relates to being bound by VSCode? What limitations should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

[] Step 4: What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to operating within VSCode? What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

[] Step 5: Save the interview within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-delivery-interviews/` named `[persona-name].md`.


### Phase 4 - Research & Compile Data

[] Step 1: To aid in the quality of the overall course, please take each SME's outline and then adopt the persona of a Research Assistant.

[] Step 2: Borrowing the perspective of a Professor of Education and Research, create a step by step plan to research all content specified in the individual SME's outline.

[] Step 3: Work through the research outline and plan and use all tools available to you. Search the web for academic papers, professional documentation, and other reputable resources to develop complete answers to the questions asked in the outline.

[] Step 4: Compile all research, examples, and relevant data. Organize your thoughts into a well-cited analysis and conversation that responds to all parts of the relevant SME outline.

[] Step 5: Save the complete thesis-quality research paper within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-research/` named `[persona-name].md`.
