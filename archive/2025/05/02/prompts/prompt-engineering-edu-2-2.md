**Agent Instructions:** ***Do Not Output. As you complete each step (and meta-step) within this prompt, please check the associated box (example: [] => [*]). Verify each check mark after completing checking each step. Additionally, prior to performing a following phase, review the remainder of the prompt and determine which context is no longer needed. Once completed, please offload the context that is no longer needed. Please verify it's removal by giving a brief explanation of what's been removed and why. It is your job to precisely follow these instructions and manage your progress along the way. It is also your job to manage switching out the different persona. Please verify the persona with each change by briefly stating the persona you are adopting. ***

**Original Concept**
We just had a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review that discussion: `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/sme-group-interview.md`. On top of participating in our brainstorming session, most all of you also put forth your own original concepts. Make yourselves familiar with everyone's initial concepts within here: `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`. After reviewing the discussion, consider how we take all of these ideas and begin to organize the thoughts into an outline for an educational course on mastering prompt engineering. Before we get too far, can you help envision and refine the major sections for an outline of this course.

**Curriculum:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/curriculum.md`

**Pre-Analysis:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-analysis`

**Pre-Interviews:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-interviews`

**Facilitator Guidance**
We just completed round two of a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review the agreed upon `Curriculum` and the resulting `Pre-Analysis` and `Pre-Interviews` from the first part one of this round. In this second part of the second round, we're going to work with SMEs to create outlines for pre-researching material needed in preparation of the next round's creation of final deliverables. You will be guiding research assistants through this rounds pre-research phase.

**Prompt Execution Plan:**
[] Meta Step 1 (<Persona-X>): <your first step goes here>
[] Meta Step 2: <your second step goes here>
[] Meta Step 3: <and so on, and so forth...>

### Phase 1 - Meta Analysis
[] Step 1: Analyze this prompt and determine the best mix of personas to facilitate this rounds pre-research phase for next rounds' group discussion on converting the `Original Concept` into a fully developed plan for researching and developing and educational course on the `Original Concept`. Please adopt the relevant persona to help facilitate the pre-research.

[] Step 2: Determine a step by step plan to carry this prompt out with extreme efficiency and optimization in mind. Consider slow is okay. Tolerance for errors is low, and my expectations of UX are very high. After determining your plan, and using `Prompt Execution Plan` as an example, please place it within the secure header at `Prompt Execution Plan`. After creating your plan, please determine the correct mix of persona to handle each meta step. Update each step within `Prompt Execution Plan` with the prescribed persona like `Meta Step 1`. 

### Phase 2 - Invitations & Analyzing Prerequisites

[] Step 1: Invite these experts to analyze our `Concept` and `Curriculum` for a another round planning for our refined group session where they'll marry the `Concept` and `Curriculum` with the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis` and `Pre-Interviews`. Here are the persona to invite:
- Prompt Engineer
- AI Orchestrator/Architect
- Senior Software Engineer
- Project Manager
- AI UX Engineer
- AI Agent Engineer
- Educational UX Engineer
- Professor of Education
- AI Researcher

[] Step 2: We need to prepare this round's subdirectory, so within `[absolute_path]/round-2` directory, please create the following subdirectories:
- `pre-outlines`
- `pre-research`

[] Step 3: Verify we are prepared for our session, please confirm our prepared directory `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-outlines/`.

[] Step 4: To prepare for this rounds deliverables, have each expert create a thorough abstract and outline for a thesis-quality paper exploring all facets of their analysis. In your outline, be as detailed and instructional as you can. We'll hand these off to research assistants to aid and guide their in-depth research. 

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2, Part II

[] Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs outlines and research any topics you might need to prepare for working with a Professor of Research and multiple Research Assistants to conduct this session's thesis-quality research papers.

analysis and research any topics you might need to prepare for leading a group collaboration session where you'll walk away with a complete and detailed set of requirements and roadmaps.

The facilitator is responsible for managing the prompt execution plan and ensuring it's veracity and proper.

[] Step 4:
To aid in the quality of the overall course, please instruct them to be thorough in their analysis, cite any sources, and provide a proper thesis-quality conversation of these particular convergences. Save their initial work within `[absolute_path]/round-3/pre-analysis/` named `[persona-name].md`.

[] Step 5: Save the interview within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-interviews/` named `[persona-name].md`.







### Phase 3 - Create Requested Assets

Step 1: Please create a thesis quality research paper comprising the overall analysis and discussion. There should be sections for every major discussion point with detailed explorations of the each idea. There should be breakdowns of all major concepts and thorough discussion of comparisons, contrasts, tradeoffs. Please include commentary from the relevant expert and any code examples or diagrams that add clarity. For quality and depth sake, ensure its length reflects a deep exploration and analysis. More discussion is preferred to less.

Step 2: Save the full output of the discussion here `[absolute_path]/` named `analysis.md`.

[] Step 5: Save the outline within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-outlines/` named `[persona-name].md`.

Please create the `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-outlines/` named `[persona-name].md`.


[] Step 4: Instruct all experts to analyze our `Original Concept` and `Curriculum` with the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis` and `Pre-Interviews` and have them write out their initial thoughts, concerns, challenges, and insight on how we marry this collection of ideas and develop well-defined requirements and a step by step plan ("roadmap") for guiding both the research and development phases of creating a comprehensive curriculum on prompt engineering mastery, with a focus on software engineering.
