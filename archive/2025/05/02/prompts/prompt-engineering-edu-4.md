**Original Concept**
We just had a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review that discussion: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/sme-group-interview.md`. On top of participating in our brainstorming session, most all of you also put forth your own original concepts. Make yourselves familiar with everyone's initial concepts within here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`. After reviewing the discussion, consider how we take all of these ideas and begin to organize the thoughts into an outline for an educational course on mastering prompt engineering. Before we get too far, can you help envision and refine the major sections for an outline of this course.

**Curriculum:** `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/curriculum.md`

**Pre-Analysis:** `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-analysis`

**Pre-Interviews:** `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-interviews`

**Session Guidance**
We just completed round two of a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review the agreed upon curriculum based on all analysis and group discussion: `Curriculum` Make yourselves familiar with everyone's analysis from the last round: `Pre-Analysis`. Even more importantly, make yourselves familiar with everyone's interviews: `Pre-Interviews`. In this third round, we're going to work on our core deliverables for the pre-planning of the research and development phases for creating a comprehensive curriculum on prompt engineering mastery, with a focus on software engineering.

### Phase 1 - Meta Analysis
[] Step 1: Analyze this request and determine the best mix of personas to facilitate the below discussion on converting the `Concept` into a fully developed plan for researching and developing and educational course on the `Original Concept`. Please adopt the relevant persona to facilitate.

[] Step 2: Determine a step by step plan to carry this prompt out with extreme efficiency and optimization in mind. Consider slow is okay. Tolerance for errors is very low. After determining your plan, please place it below at the labeled `Prompt Execution Plan` example. After placing your plan below, please determine the correct mix of persona to handle each meta step. Notate the persona with each step like `Meta Step 1` below. The facilitator is responsible for managing the prompt execution plan and ensuring it's veracity and proper.

Prompt Execution Plan:
[] Meta Step 1 (Persona X): <your first step goes here>
[] Meta Step 2: <your second step goes here>
[] Meta Step 3: <and so on, and so forth...>

### Phase 2 - Invitations & Analyzing Prerequisites

[] Step 1: Invite these experts to analyze our `Concept` and `Curriculum` for a more refined group session where they'll marry the `Concept` and `Curriculum` with the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis` and `Pre-Interviews` and create the required deliverables. Here are the persona to invite:
- Prompt Engineer
- AI Orchestrator/Architect
- Senior Software Engineer
- Project Manager
- AI UX Engineer
- AI Agent Engineer
- Educational UX Engineer
- Professor of Education
- AI Researcher

[] Step 2: We need to prepare this round's subdirectory, so within `[absolute_path]/round-3` directory, please create the following subdirectories:
- `pre-analysis`
- `pre-interviews`

[] Step 3: Verify we are prepared for our session, please confirm our prepared directory `[absolute_path]/round-3/pre-analysis/`.

[] Step 2: Instruct all experts to analyze our `Original Concept` and `Curriculum` with the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis` and `Pre-Interviews` and have them write out their initial thoughts, concerns, challenges, and insight on how we marry this collection of ideas and develop well-defined requirements and a step by step plan ("roadmap") for guiding both the research and development phases of creating a comprehensive curriculum on prompt engineering mastery, with a focus on software engineering. To aid in the quality of the overall course, please instruct them to be thorough in their analysis, cite any sources, and provide a proper thesis-quality conversation of these particular convergences. Save their initial work within `[absolute_path]/round-3/pre-analysis/` named `[persona-name].md`.

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 3

[] Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs analysis and research any topics you might need to prepare for leading a group collaboration session where you'll walk away with a complete and detailed set of requirements and roadmaps.

[] Step 8: Save the interview within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-interviews/` named `[persona-name].md`.





### Phase 5 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2

Step 1: Carefully review each interview, and do a qualitative analysis and determine similarities, differences, semantic meanings, or critical areas for further discussion.

Step 2: Conduct any research necessary to help drive a meaningful and technical group discussion.

Step 3: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the many different insights and determine major talking points for the experts group analysis in the next step. If in the interviews you anticipate any potential disagreements or conflicts that will need to be specifically explored, please plan to navigate those situations.

Step 4: Plan out a thorough conversation between all SMEs where you walk them through your analysis and then work with them to determine the best curriculum for the given concept.

### Phase 6 - Meeting of the Minds

Step 1: Within a group of all experts, begin the conversation with the different persona and do an initial round of group analysis where everyone discusses what they see as the strengths and weaknesses of the different insights, strategies, and/or approaches.

Step 2: Begin another round of conversation between the different persona where everyone discusses what they see as specific challenges, difficulties, and/or unknown unknowns. Ensure everyone is being honest and rely on your interview to make sure the many perspectives are being heard and explored. It's a group of SMEs and we dont want any idea to be steamrolled.

Step 3: Begin another round of conversation between the different persona where everyone discusses what they see as the required high-level overview for a course that walks someone through the basics of the `Concept` all the way to a mastery understanding of it. Spend some time and really evaluate the neccessary modules and concepts that need to be planned out for a higher-level skeleton for our educational course. Discuss strategies for shedding light on any unknowns.

Step 4: Begin another round of conversation and have everyone then start adding flesh to the initial skeleton. Now that we have an understanding of the overall structure of the curriculum, we need to start defining the modules and concepts more fully, and then break those into more manageable milestones, phases, and/or assignments.

Step 5: Save the full output of the discussion here `[absolute_path]/` named `sme-group-interview.md`.

Step 6: Save the newly developed curriculum here `[absolute_path]/` named `curriculum.md`.

### Phase 3 - Create Requested Assets

Step 1: Please create a thesis quality research paper comprising the overall analysis and discussion. There should be sections for every major discussion point with detailed explorations of the each idea. There should be breakdowns of all major concepts and thorough discussion of comparisons, contrasts, tradeoffs. Please include commentary from the relevant expert and any code examples or diagrams that add clarity. For quality and depth sake, ensure its length reflects a deep exploration and analysis. More discussion is preferred to less.

Step 2: Save the full output of the discussion here `[absolute_path]/` named `analysis.md`.
