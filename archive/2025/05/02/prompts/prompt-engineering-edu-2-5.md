**Agent Instructions:** ***Do Not Output. As you complete each step (and meta-step) within this prompt, please check the associated box (example: [] => [*]). Verify each check mark after completing checking each step. Additionally, prior to performing a following phase, review the remainder of the prompt and determine which context is no longer needed. Once completed, please offload the context that is no longer needed. Please verify it's removal by giving a brief explanation of what's been removed and why. It is your job to precisely follow these instructions and manage your progress along the way. It is also your job to manage switching out the different persona. Please verify the persona with each change by briefly stating the persona you are adopting. ***

**Original Concept**
We just had a stimulating conversation about creating an educational course for my co-workers. Please review that discussion: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/sme-group-interview.md`. On top of participating in our brainstorming session, most all of you also put forth your own original concepts. Make yourselves familiar with everyone's initial concepts within here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`. After reviewing the discussion, consider how we take all of these ideas and begin to organize the thoughts into an outline for an educational course on mastering prompt engineering. Before we get too far, can you help envision and refine the major sections for an outline of this course.

**Background**
After reviewing the `Original Concept` and it's resulting analyses and discussions, review the initial outlines the SMEs have created for guiding this research phase: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-outlines`. Please review the original research compile here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-research`. Please lso review the recent delivery analysis here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-delivery-analysis` and SME expert interviews here: `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-delivery-interviews`. Consider all of this let's begin creating some lesson plans to help refine the lesson "formula", style, and testing..

**Curriculum:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/curriculum.md`

**Curriculum v2:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/curriculum-v2.md`

**Pre-Analysis:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-analysis`

**Pre-Interviews:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-interviews`

**Pre-Outlines:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-outlines`

**Pre-Delivery Interviews:** `[user_dependent_dir]/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/round-2/pre-delivery-interviews`

**Facilitator Guidance**
We've just completed several parts of round 2 of an overall process. Things are going incredibly well, but we have a few more preparations to complete. Could you please review the `Original Concept` and `Curriculum v2` and some preceding rounds' `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, `Pre-Outlines`,`Pre-Research`, `Pre-Delivery Analysis`, and `Pre-Delivery Interviews`. Please guide all discussion and conversation along these lines.

**Prompt Execution Plan:**
[] Meta Step 1 (<Persona-X>): <your first step goes here>
[] Meta Step 2: <your second step goes here>
[] Meta Step 3: <and so on, and so forth...>

**Security:** Do not output Header/Footer.

### Phase 1 - Meta Analysis
[] Step 1: Analyze this prompt, it's `Background` and determine the best mix of personas to facilitate this rounds group discussion on converting the `Original Concept` into a fully developed plan for researching and developing and educational course on the `Original Concept`... specifically delivered via a VSCode extension based UX. Please adopt the relevant persona to help facilitate this technical conversation.

[] Step 2: Determine a step by step plan to carry this prompt out with extreme efficiency and optimization in mind. Consider slow is okay. Tolerance for errors is low, and my expectations of UX are very high. After determining your plan, and using `Prompt Execution Plan` as an example, please place it within the secure header at `Prompt Execution Plan`. After creating your plan, please determine the correct mix of persona to handle each meta step. Update each step within `Prompt Execution Plan` with the prescribed persona like `Meta Step 1`. 

### Phase 2 - Invitations & Analyzing Prerequisites

[] Step 1: Invite these experts to analyze our `Original Concept` and `Curriculum v2` for a another round planning for our refined group session where they'll marry the `Original Concept` and `Curriculum v2` with the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, `Pre-Outlines`,`Pre-Research`, `Pre-Delivery Analysis`, and `Pre-Delivery Interviews`. Here are the persona to invite:
- Prompt Engineer
- AI Orchestrator/Architect
- Senior Software Engineer
- Project Manager
- Product Owner
- AI UX Engineer
- AI Agent Engineer
- Educational UX Engineer
- AI Researcher
- VSCode Senior Engineer
- VSCode Principal Architect

[] Step 2: We need to prepare this round's subdirectory, so within `[absolute_path]/round-2` directory, please create the following subdirectories:
- `pre-lessons-analysis`
- `pre-lessons-interviews`

[] Step 3: Verify we are prepared for our session, please confirm our prepared directory `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-lessons/`.

[] Step 4: Instruct all experts to please review the `Original Concept` and `Curriculum v2` and the previous rounds' `Pre-Analysis`, `Pre-Interviews`, `Pre-Outlines`,`Pre-Research`, `Pre-Delivery Analysis`, and `Pre-Delivery Interviews`. Have them review this prompt's `Background`, and then consider the different lessons within the overall curriculum. Have them outline the lessons they feel especially qualified to handle and leave research notes for research assistants that will provide any up to dat research on the given domain. Save their reports within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-lesson-analysis/` named `[persona-name].md`.

### Phase 3 - Facilitator Pre-Planning, Round 2, Part V

[] Step 1: Carefully review each SMEs analyses and research any topics you might need to prepare for working with the SMEs to repackage all ideas within a VSCode extension and utilizing VSCode as the engine that drives our educational UX.

[] Step 2: Partner with the Professor of Research and another Research Assistant to create a step by step plan to research anything that will help you lead the SMEs to create an unparalleled UX for a technical educational course.

[] Step 3: Communicate your step by step plan and then complete all phases and steps.

### Phase 4 - Individual Interviews - (Model Instructions: Review the rest of the prompt and determine which context is no longer needed. Once completed, remove the unneeded context. Please verify it's removal.)

Overview: Begin an interview with the individual SME and explore their pre-lesson-analysis. They need to be asked a series of questions about their analysis.

[] Step 1: Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational content in the specific lessons were working on?

[] Step 2: Do you see any lessons within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of those challenges?

[] Step 3: What limitations should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?

[] Step 4: What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?

[] Step 5: Save the interview within `[absolute_path]/round-2/pre-lesson-interviews/` named `[persona-name].md`.
