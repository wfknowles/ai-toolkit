## 1. Introduction

Following the initial brainstorming session that established the vision and core concepts for a "Prompt Mastery" course (documented in `/Users/willknowles/.wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/prompt-mastery/brainstorm.md`), this paper details the subsequent phase focused on translating those concepts into a structured curriculum outline. The goal remained to create an effective educational experience for approximately 200 software engineers, enabling them to master prompt engineering techniques within the Cursor IDE.

This phase utilized the same panel of 11 simulated Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and followed the process outlined in the `prompt-engineering-edu-1.md` prompt. This involved individual SME analysis of the initial concept, targeted interviews to explore pedagogical strategies and potential challenges, facilitator synthesis, and a final group discussion to refine and agree upon a detailed course outline. This document summarizes this curriculum design process, highlighting key discussions, decisions, and the resulting course structure.

## 2. Methodology: From Concept to Curriculum

The process involved several structured steps:

1.  **Input Analysis:** The primary inputs were the outputs of the previous brainstorming session, specifically the `sme-group-interview.md` transcript and the `brainstorm.md` research paper containing the top 20 refined concepts.
2.  **Environment Setup:** New directories were created for this phase (`.../05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/` and `.../pre-analysis/`).
3.  **Individual SME Pre-Analysis (Outline Focus):** Each SME reviewed the prior work and formulated initial thoughts specifically on a potential course outline structure, considering module groupings, flow, and key topics from their perspective. These were saved to the new `pre-analysis` directory.
4.  **Facilitator Pre-Planning (Round 1):** The facilitator reviewed these 11 outline proposals, identifying areas of convergence and divergence, and preparing for individual discussions.
5.  **Individual SME Interviews:** The facilitator conducted simulated interviews with each SME. These explored potential challenges in creating educational content from the concepts, identified high-cognitive-load topics requiring careful breakdown, elicited insights into effective learning moments ("Aha!" moments), uncovered potential blindspots, and collaboratively sketched initial outline skeletons.
6.  **Facilitator Pre-Planning (Round 2):** Interview notes were synthesized. A consolidated 5-part structure emerged as a strong consensus point. Key discussion topics for the group session were identified, focusing on module details, activity design, advanced topic scope, and capstone definition.
7.  **SME Group Interview (Curriculum Focus):** A final group discussion was simulated (transcript: `sme-group-interview.md` in the `.../05/02/edu/prompt-engineering/` directory). The SMEs collectively refined the 5-part structure, debated module content and activities, determined the appropriate depth for advanced topics, defined the capstone project scope, and discussed cross-cutting themes like ethics and evaluation.
8.  **Curriculum Outline Generation:** Based on the consensus from the group interview, the final detailed curriculum outline (`curriculum.md`) was generated.
9.  **Analysis Paper Generation:** This document was created to detail the process, discussions, and rationale involved in developing the curriculum outline.

## 3. Key Discussion Points & Decisions in Curriculum Design

Several critical themes emerged during the individual interviews and final group discussion, shaping the curriculum:

### 3.1. Balancing Theory and Practice
*   **Challenge:** Avoiding overly theoretical modules disconnected from engineers' practical needs, while still providing necessary foundational understanding.
*   **Decision:** Integrate theory "just-in-time" within practical contexts. As articulated by Prof Ed and PR, concepts like tokenization or context windows are introduced *when* they directly impact the success of a practical prompting exercise in Cursor. This leverages situated learning and manages cognitive load.
*   **Quote (AIR):** "Some fundamentals are crucial... Understanding context windows... tokenization basics... and *why* techniques like CoT work helps engineers move beyond cargo-culting prompts. But keep it high-level initially, maybe linked directly to Cursor examples."
*   **Quote (PR):** "Situated learning â€“ learn the theory *in the context* of a realistic SE task within the IDE."

### 3.2. Defining the MVP and Learning Progression
*   **Challenge:** Delivering immediate value to encourage adoption while building towards advanced mastery.
*   **Decision:** Adopt a clear MVP scope focusing on foundational concepts and core Cursor interactions for common SE tasks (Units 1 & 2). Structure the course using pedagogical scaffolding, aligning with Bloom's Taxonomy (as suggested by Prof Ed) to move from understanding/applying to analyzing/evaluating and finally creating.
*   **Quote (PO):** "Foundations & Core Craft represent the MVP, delivering immediate practical skills."
*   **Quote (Prof Ed):** "Aligning these parts with cognitive progression, perhaps using Bloom's Taxonomy... provides a sound pedagogical flow."

### 3.3. Scope of Advanced Topics (Agentics & Workflows)
*   **Challenge:** Determining the appropriate depth for complex topics like agent architectures and tool use for a broad audience.
*   **Decision:** Focus on *prompting patterns* that enable workflows and agentic behaviors, rather than deep agent framework implementation. Introduce core agentic concepts (loops, planning, memory, tool use) conceptually, supported by simple, practical examples (e.g., prompt chaining, RAG, prompting for simulated tools).
*   **Quote (AAE):** "Keep the tool use examples very practical... Focus on how *prompting* enables these agentic behaviors."
*   **Quote (AOA):** "Focus on *workflows*. Teach prompt chaining explicitly, basic RAG patterns... meta-prompting... These are powerful extensions... applicable to many SE tasks."

### 3.4. Practicality and Relevance (Cursor Integration)
*   **Challenge:** Ensuring exercises and examples are directly relevant to the engineers' daily work within their primary tool, Cursor.
*   **Decision:** Emphasize hands-on activities within Cursor or a high-fidelity simulation/playground from the start. Use realistic (potentially anonymized internal or relevant open-source) code examples. Frame exercises around common SE tasks (debugging, refactoring, documentation, testing).
*   **Quote (SSE):** "Absolutely need hands-on in Cursor from day one... Examples *must* use relevant languages/frameworks from our stack."
*   **Quote (AI UX):** "The experience *in* Cursor is paramount... The course must mirror that workflow."

### 3.5. Assessment and Learning Transfer
*   **Challenge:** Measuring learning effectively and ensuring skills transfer back to the job.
*   **Decision:** Utilize authentic assessments mirroring real SE tasks (Prof Ed). Emphasize frequent, low-stakes formative feedback (PR). Define a project-based capstone allowing application of multiple skills (SSE, Prof Ed). Explore methods to assess transfer, such as analyzing usage patterns or peer reviews focused on AI interaction (PR).
*   **Quote (Prof Ed):** "Use authentic assessments mimicking real SE challenges solvable with sophisticated prompting in Cursor."
*   **Quote (PR):** "Measuring actual learning *transfer*... is difficult but crucial - need to design for this..."

### 3.6. Learning Experience and Platform
*   **Challenge:** Creating an engaging and effective learning environment.
*   **Decision:** Require an interactive platform with an integrated playground/simulator, visualizations for complex concepts, and clear, actionable feedback mechanisms (Ed UX). Prioritize accessibility and usability (AI UX, Ed UX).
*   **Quote (Ed UX):** "An embedded Cursor simulation or a tightly integrated playground is non-negotiable... Interactive visualizations... are key for comprehension."

## 4. Resulting Curriculum Outline Structure

The consensus led to a 5-Unit structure detailed in `curriculum.md`:

1.  **Unit 1: Foundations:** Focuses on understanding AI/LLMs, the value of prompting, ethical basics, and core Cursor interaction.
2.  **Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft:** Develops practical skills in fundamental techniques (Zero/Few-Shot, Context Engineering, Output Formatting, Iteration) within Cursor.
3.  **Unit 3: Building Complexity & Workflows:** Introduces reasoning techniques (CoT), handling more context (RAG concepts), basic automation (Prompt Chaining), and critical evaluation of AI output.
4.  **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques & Concepts:** Covers advanced methods (Self-Consistency, Meta-Prompting), introduces agentic concepts and prompting for (simulated) tool use, and deepens evaluation/security aspects.
5.  **Unit 5: Capstone & Continuous Learning:** Synthesizes skills through an authentic project, encourages sharing, and connects learners to ongoing resources and community.

Cross-cutting themes like ethics, security, evaluation, and Cursor integration are woven throughout these units.

## 5. Conclusion

This focused curriculum design phase successfully translated the high-level concepts from the initial brainstorming into a detailed, pedagogically sound, and practically relevant course outline. By leveraging multi-disciplinary SME input through individual analysis, targeted interviews, and collaborative discussion, key challenges were addressed, and a robust structure emerged. The resulting 5-unit curriculum, detailed in `curriculum.md`, provides a clear roadmap for developing the "Prompt Mastery" course, balancing foundational knowledge with advanced skills, theoretical understanding with practical application in Cursor, and learner engagement with rigorous assessment. This outline serves as the blueprint for the next stage: detailed content creation and platform development.
