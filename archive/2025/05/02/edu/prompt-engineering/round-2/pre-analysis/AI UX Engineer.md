# AI UX Engineer - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI UX Engineer (AI UX)

**Review:** The 5-unit structure allows weaving UX considerations throughout. The focus should be on how prompt design impacts the *engineer's experience* of efficiency, trust, control, and cognitive load when using Cursor.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts (Focus on Interaction Design):**

*   **Unit 1: Foundations**
    *   *Lesson 1.1.X: AI as Collaborator:* Abstract: Discuss interaction models (assistant, collaborator). How does prompt phrasing influence the AI's perceived role? Setting expectations for AI limitations.
    *   *Lesson 1.3.1: Cursor Interaction Patterns:* Abstract: Analyze Cursor's chat UX, context features (@, selection), diff views. Discuss usability implications.
    *   *Lesson 1.4.1: UX Impact of Bias/Hallucinations:* Abstract: How unreliable AI output erodes trust. Importance of critical evaluation from a user perspective.
*   **Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft**
    *   *Lesson 2.X: Designing for Clarity:* Abstract: Link prompt clarity/specificity directly to reducing user frustration and improving predictability of AI responses.
    *   *Lesson 2.2.X: Context - Balancing Effort & Effectiveness:* Abstract: The UX tradeoff - how much context is easy for the user to provide vs. needed by the AI? Leverage Cursor features wisely.
    *   *Lesson 2.4.1: The UX of Iteration:* Abstract: Frame prompt refinement as a user-driven debugging process. How to make iteration less frustrating? Prompts for clarification.
*   **Unit 3: Building Complexity & Workflows**
    *   *Lesson 3.1.X: CoT & Transparency:* Abstract: How CoT builds trust by showing the AI's work. Designing prompts to elicit useful explanations.
    *   *Lesson 3.3.X: Workflow Usability:* Abstract: Designing prompt chains that are easy for the user to understand, monitor, and debug.
    *   *Lesson 3.4.1: Heuristics for Evaluating AI Output:* Abstract: Adapt usability heuristics (clarity, consistency, error prevention) for engineers evaluating AI-generated code/text.
*   **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques & Concepts**
    *   *Lesson 4.X: Managing Cognitive Load:* Abstract: Discuss how complex prompts/workflows increase mental effort. Strategies for breaking down tasks, using templates.
    *   *Lesson 4.3.X: UX of Tool Use:* Abstract: Designing prompts for tool use that prioritize user control, confirmation steps for critical actions, and clear feedback.
*   **Unit 5: Capstone & Continuous Learning**
    *   *Lesson 5.X: Designing & Evaluating the Capstone UX:* Abstract: Consider the user experience of the tool/workflow created in the capstone. How would an end-user interact with it?
    *   *Lesson 5.X: Feedback Mechanisms:* Abstract: Importance of user feedback for continuously improving AI tools/prompts.

**Diagram Idea:** User journey map for debugging code with AI assistance in Cursor. Heuristic checklist for evaluating prompt usability.

**Concerns:** Need to keep the focus practical on the *engineer using Cursor*. Avoid overly academic UX theory. Ensure ethical considerations (autonomy, privacy) are integrated where relevant (e.g., tool use, handling sensitive code).
