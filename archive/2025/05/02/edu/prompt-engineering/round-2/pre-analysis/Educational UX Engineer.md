# Educational UX Engineer - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Educational UX Engineer (Ed UX)

**Review:** The 5-unit structure provides a good framework. My focus is on designing the *learning activities* and *platform features* to support the content in each module, ensuring a smooth and effective user experience.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts (Focus on Platform/Activities):**

*   **Unit 1: Foundations**
    *   *Platform:* Interactive onboarding tour; Simple embedded Cursor simulation for first prompts; Quiz tool.
    *   *Activity Design:* Guided walkthroughs of Cursor UI; Drag-and-drop prompt component identification; Multiple-choice quiz on concepts.
*   **Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft**
    *   *Platform:* Enhanced prompt playground (syntax highlighting, token counter, side-by-side comparison); Exercise engine supporting code context loading; Peer review tool.
    *   *Activity Design:* Scaffolded exercises with increasing complexity; Debugging tasks with targeted feedback; Prompt refinement challenges; Interface for submitting prompts for peer review.
*   **Unit 3: Complexity & Workflows**
    *   *Platform:* Interactive visualizations/diagrams (for CoT, RAG, Chaining); Support for multi-step prompt exercises; Rubric integration for evaluation tasks.
    *   *Activity Design:* Visual CoT tracing exercise; Simulated RAG task using provided context; Drag-and-drop prompt chain builder (conceptual); Code review interface for evaluating AI output against a rubric.
*   **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques**
    *   *Platform:* Sandboxed environment for simulated tool use; Library/Gallery of advanced prompt examples; Project proposal submission tool.
    *   *Activity Design:* Tool use simulation exercises with clear feedback; Exploration tasks using the prompt library; Guided brainstorming/proposal writing for capstone.
*   **Unit 5: Capstone & Community**
    *   *Platform:* Project workspace (individual/group); Presentation/demo sharing feature; Integrated forum or link to CoP channel; Resource library.
    *   *Activity Design:* Capstone project development milestones; Peer feedback sessions on demos; Interface for contributing to prompt library.

**Diagram Idea:** User flow diagram for the iterative prompt refinement exercise within the playground. Wireframe for the interactive CoT visualization.

**Concerns:** Ensuring the playground/simulation is robust and accurately reflects Cursor is the main technical challenge. Designing effective, non-generic feedback for programming/prompting exercises at scale is hard. Making visualizations truly interactive and useful requires significant design/dev effort.
