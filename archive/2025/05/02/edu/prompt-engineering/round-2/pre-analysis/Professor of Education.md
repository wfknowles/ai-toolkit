# Professor of Education - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Professor of Education (Prof Ed)

**Review:** The 5-Unit structure aligned with Bloom's is a good spine. Now need to flesh out modules with specific learning activities and assessments that reinforce the target cognitive levels.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts (with Activities/Assessments):**

*   **Unit 1: Foundations (Understand)**
    *   *Lesson 1.1: AI Value & Ethics:* Abstract + Activity: Case study analysis of AI impact on SE; Group discussion on ethical scenarios.
    *   *Lesson 1.2: Prompt Anatomy:* Abstract + Activity: Deconstruct sample prompts; Identify components; Write simple prompts.
    *   *Lesson 1.3: Cursor Basics:* Abstract + Activity: Guided tutorial; Simple code explanation request.
    *   *Assessment:* Short quiz (understanding); Submit a basic working prompt.
*   **Unit 2: Core Craft (Apply)**
    *   *Lesson 2.1: Prompting Techniques I:* Abstract (Zero/Few-Shot) + Activity: Convert zero-shot to few-shot prompt; Apply to generate styled code.
    *   *Lesson 2.2: Context Engineering I:* Abstract + Activity: Practice different context provision methods (@, selection) in Cursor; Debug context issues.
    *   *Lesson 2.3: Output Formatting I:* Abstract + Activity: Prompt for specific formats (JSON, MD); Fix poorly formatted output.
    *   *Lesson 2.4: Iterative Refinement Process:* Abstract + Activity: Debug a deliberately flawed prompt through multiple iterations; Peer review of refinement process.
    *   *Assessment:* Practical exercise requiring application of multiple techniques; Peer feedback on prompt quality.
*   **Unit 3: Complexity & Workflows (Analyze, Evaluate)**
    *   *Lesson 3.1: CoT for Analysis:* Abstract + Activity: Use CoT to debug complex code provided; Analyze the reasoning steps.
    *   *Lesson 3.2: RAG Concepts & Context II:* Abstract + Activity: Evaluate prompts using provided external context snippets; Analyze context window limitations.
    *   *Lesson 3.3: Prompt Chaining I:* Abstract + Activity: Design a 2-step prompt chain diagram; Implement & test it.
    *   *Lesson 3.4: Evaluating AI Outputs I:* Abstract + Activity: Critique AI-generated code/tests using a rubric; Identify potential flaws.
    *   *Assessment:* Analysis task comparing different prompts for a complex problem; Simple workflow design/implementation.
*   **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques (Evaluate, Create Prep)**
    *   *Lesson 4.1: Adv. Prompting Toolbox:* Abstract (Self-Consistency, Meta) + Activity: Apply Self-Consistency to reasoning task; Experiment with a meta-prompt template.
    *   *Lesson 4.2/4.3: Agent Concepts & Tool Use:* Abstract + Activity: Diagram a simple agent loop; Write prompt for simulated tool use.
    *   *Lesson 4.4: Evaluation II & Security:* Abstract + Activity: Evaluate complex output for security flaws; Discuss prompt injection risks.
    *   *Assessment:* Short practical tasks applying advanced techniques; Capstone project proposal.
*   **Unit 5: Capstone & Community (Create, Synthesize)**
    *   *Lesson 5.1: Capstone Workshop:* Activity: Dedicated time for project work with instructor/peer support; Milestones check-ins.
    *   *Lesson 5.2: Showcase & Feedback:* Activity: Project demos; Structured peer feedback session.
    *   *Lesson 5.3: Continuous Learning:* Activity: Group discussion on forming internal CoP; Share resources.
    *   *Assessment:* Capstone project rubric (process, outcome, reflection); Contribution to prompt library (optional).
