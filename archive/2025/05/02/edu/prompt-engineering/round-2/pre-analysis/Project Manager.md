# Project Manager - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Project Manager (PM)

**Review:** The 5-Unit curriculum provides a good framework for planning. My focus is translating this into actionable items for the Research & Development phases, defining scope, and ensuring project health.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts (Focus on Research/Dev Planning):**

*   **Research Phase Roadmap Requirements:**
    *   **R1: Finalize Learning Objectives:** For each module in `curriculum.md`, define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound (SMART) learning objectives.
    *   **R2: Content Deep Dive:** Research & document best practices, core concepts, and *specific, relevant* SE examples (in target languages/frameworks) for each lesson abstract.
    *   **R3: Tooling/Platform Research:** Investigate platform options (build vs. buy/adapt LMS) based on Ed UX requirements (playground, simulation fidelity, feedback). Research simulated tool integration feasibility.
    *   **R4: Assessment Strategy Detail:** Define specific formative and summative assessment methods for each unit (rubrics for PBL/Capstone, quiz formats, peer review structure).
    *   **R5: Pilot Program Design:** Define pilot scope, target participants, schedule, feedback mechanisms, and success criteria.
*   **Development Phase Roadmap Requirements:**
    *   **D1: Platform Implementation/Configuration:** Set up the chosen learning platform, configure playground/simulations, integrate feedback tools.
    *   **D2: Content Creation (MVP):** Develop lesson materials (text, visuals, videos?) for Units 1-2 based on Research Phase outputs.
    *   **D3: Activity/Exercise Development (MVP):** Build interactive exercises, playground scenarios, quizzes, peer review setups for Units 1-2.
    *   **D4: Pilot Execution & Analysis:** Run the pilot program, collect data/feedback, analyze results against success criteria.
    *   **D5: MVP Iteration:** Refine Units 1-2 content, activities, and platform based on pilot feedback.
    *   **D6: Content Creation (Advanced):** Develop lesson materials for Units 3-5.
    *   **D7: Activity/Exercise Development (Advanced):** Build exercises, simulations, capstone project framework for Units 3-5.
    *   **D8: Internal Marketing & Rollout Prep:** Create communication materials, schedule training sessions, prepare support resources.
    *   **D9: Full Course Launch & Monitoring:** Deploy full course, monitor adoption, track success metrics.
    *   **D10: Maintenance & Community Setup:** Implement content update process, launch community of practice channels.

**Diagram Idea:** Gantt chart for Research Phase. High-level roadmap visual for Development Phase.

**Concerns:** Accurately estimating effort for content creation and platform development (especially simulation fidelity). Ensuring SMEs have allocated time for research and development phases. Managing scope creep, especially for advanced modules and the capstone.
