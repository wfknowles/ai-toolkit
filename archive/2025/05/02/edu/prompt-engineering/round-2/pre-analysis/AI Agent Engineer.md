# AI Agent Engineer - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI Agent Engineer (AAE)

**Review:** The curriculum correctly positions deep agentics as advanced/conceptual for this audience, focusing on prompt chaining and basic tool use as the practical core. My lesson ideas focus on building the understanding needed for those practical workflow/agentic concepts.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts:**

*   **Unit 3: Building Complexity & Workflows**
    *   *Lesson 3.3.1: Prompt Chaining Fundamentals:* Abstract: Explain decomposing tasks. Show how to pass output text as input context. Discuss simple state management via prompt content. Contrast with single complex prompts.
    *   *Lesson 3.3.2: Designing Basic Workflows:* Abstract: Introduce simple workflow patterns (e.g., Generate->Refine, Analyze->Summarize). Diagramming workflows.
*   **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques & Concepts**
    *   *Lesson 4.2.1: Agentic Loops (Conceptual):* Abstract: Explain Observe-Think-Act visually. Map prompt techniques (CoT, Chaining) to the 'Think' phase. Discuss the role of prompts in planning.
    *   *Lesson 4.2.2: Memory for Prompts/Agents:* Abstract: Explain short-term (context window) vs. long-term (conceptual RAG/vector stores). How prompts interact with short-term memory. How RAG provides long-term context *to* prompts.
    *   *Lesson 4.3.1: Prompting for Tool Selection:* Abstract: How to phrase prompts to make the LLM choose a tool (hypothetically or from a limited set). Examples: "Should I lint this code or generate tests?"
    *   *Lesson 4.3.2: Prompting for Tool Execution & Output Handling:* Abstract: Formatting prompts to call a (simulated) tool with parameters. Handling the tool's text output in a subsequent prompt step. Basic error handling prompts ("Tool failed, what now?").
    *   *Lesson 4.1.X: (Integrate with PE/AOA) Meta-Prompting for Workflow Generation:* Abstract: Concept of a prompt that outlines the steps (generates the prompt chain) for another LLM call.
*   **Unit 5: Capstone**
    *   *Lesson 5.1.1: Capstone - Agentic Helper Design:* Abstract: Guide learners in designing their simple agentic workflow project (e.g., the doc generator). Focus on the prompt chain, any simulated tool use, and state management.

**Diagram Idea:** Visual depiction of Observe-Think-Act loop mapping to specific prompt techniques. Flowchart for a simple prompt chain with state passing. Diagram showing prompt interaction with short-term vs. long-term memory concepts.

**Concerns:** Ensuring the simulated tool use is meaningful but not overly complex to implement in the learning platform. Clearly differentiating prompt chaining (linear execution) from more dynamic agent loops. Making memory concepts understandable without requiring infrastructure knowledge.
