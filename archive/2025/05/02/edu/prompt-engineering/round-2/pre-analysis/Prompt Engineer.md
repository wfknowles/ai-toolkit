# Prompt Engineer - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Prompt Engineer (PE)

**Review:** The 5-Unit structure covers the key areas of prompt engineering well, progressing logically. My lesson ideas focus on the practical skills and techniques within each module.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts (Focus on Prompting Craft):**

*   **Unit 1: Foundations**
    *   *Lesson 1.2.1: The Art of Instruction:* Abstract: Writing clear, concise, unambiguous instructions. Avoiding jargon. Defining desired actions.
    *   *Lesson 1.2.2: Role Prompting Basics:* Abstract: How defining a role (`Act as...`) influences tone and output style. Simple examples.
*   **Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft**
    *   *Lesson 2.1.1: Crafting Effective Few-Shot Examples:* Abstract: What makes a good example? Relevance, clarity, demonstrating the desired *pattern* (not just input/output).
    *   *Lesson 2.2.1: Practical Context Selection:* Abstract: Techniques for identifying and providing *minimal sufficient context* from code. Using delimiters.
    *   *Lesson 2.3.1: Prompting for Structured Data:* Abstract: Reliable techniques for getting JSON, Markdown, lists, etc. Handling formatting errors.
    *   *Lesson 2.4.1: Systematic Prompt Debugging:* Abstract: Checklist/flowchart for troubleshooting prompts (Instruction? Context? Example? Format? Model limitation?).
*   **Unit 3: Building Complexity & Workflows**
    *   *Lesson 3.1.1: CoT Prompt Variations:* Abstract: Different ways to phrase CoT prompts (Zero-shot vs Few-shot). When to use each for debugging vs. explanation.
    *   *Lesson 3.2.1: Prompting with Retrieved Context (RAG):* Abstract: How to structure prompts that include external text snippets for grounding/answering questions.
    *   *Lesson 3.3.1: Passing Information in Prompt Chains:* Abstract: Techniques for ensuring information/state flows correctly between chained prompts (using clear variable names/placeholders in context).
*   **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques & Concepts**
    *   *Lesson 4.1.1: Applying Self-Consistency:* Abstract: Practical guide - how many samples? How to aggregate results (majority vote)? When is it worth the cost?
    *   *Lesson 4.1.2: Introduction to Meta-Prompting:* Abstract: Simple patterns like prompt templating or having one prompt generate parameters for another.
    *   *Lesson 4.3.1: Designing Prompts for Tool Use:* Abstract: Focus on clear action verbs, parameter specification, and instructing the LLM on how to *use* the tool's output.
    *   *Lesson 4.4.1: Prompt Injection Awareness:* Abstract: Recognizing simple injection attacks and basic mitigation (input sanitization conceptual, instruction defense).
*   **Unit 5: Capstone & Continuous Learning**
    *   *Lesson 5.X: Building a Personal Prompt Library:* Abstract: Strategies for organizing and documenting effective prompts/templates for reuse.

**Diagram Idea:** Decision tree for choosing between zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT. Flowchart for prompt debugging.

**Concerns:** Ensuring enough practice time for each specific technique. Providing good, varied examples for different SE tasks and languages. Keeping the debugging lessons practical and actionable.
