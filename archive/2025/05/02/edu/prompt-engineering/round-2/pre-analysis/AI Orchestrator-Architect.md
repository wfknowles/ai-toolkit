# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI Orchestrator/Architect (AOA)

**Review:** The 5-unit structure works. Units 3 and 4 are key for introducing workflow/orchestration patterns at an appropriate level for engineers using Cursor.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts (Focus on Workflow Patterns):**

*   **Unit 3: Building Complexity & Workflows**
    *   *Lesson 3.2.1: RAG Patterns for SE:* Abstract: Explain Retrieval (finding relevant docs/code) + Augmentation (adding to prompt) + Generation pattern. Focus on prompt structure for incorporating context. Discuss simple context summarization/selection prompt strategies.
    *   *Lesson 3.3.1: Prompt Chaining Patterns:* Abstract: Introduce common patterns: Linear chains, Generate-and-Refine, Scatter-Gather (asking multiple questions then synthesizing). Show how to pass state via context.
    *   *Lesson 3.3.2: Basic Error Handling in Chains:* Abstract: Simple strategies like conditional prompting ("If previous step failed, then...") or retry prompts.
*   **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques & Concepts**
    *   *Lesson 4.1.1: Meta-Prompting Patterns:* Abstract: Focus on template generation (prompt creates a specific prompt structure) and conditional logic generation (prompt outputs instructions for next step).
    *   *Lesson 4.2.1: Agentic Workflow Patterns (Conceptual):* Abstract: Explain ReAct loop using a simple diagram. Contrast with linear prompt chaining. Discuss role of prompts in planning/tool selection phases.
    *   *Lesson 4.3.1: Prompting Tool APIs (Simulated):* Abstract: Designing prompts for structured API calls (input parameters). Parsing structured output (e.g., JSON) from tools in subsequent prompts.
    *   *Lesson 4.X: Performance/Cost of Workflows:* Abstract: Discuss latency implications of multi-step chains. Token costs. Briefly mention caching strategies (conceptual).
    *   *Lesson 4.X: Security for Workflows:* Abstract: Risks of passing sensitive data between prompts; Validating tool outputs; Preventing prompt injection in chained calls.
*   **Unit 5: Capstone**
    *   *Lesson 5.1.1: Designing a Robust Workflow:* Abstract: Guide capstone design emphasizing error handling, clear state management (in prompts), and evaluation for the chosen SE task.

**Diagram Idea:** Visual comparison of Linear Prompt Chain vs. ReAct Loop. Diagram of RAG flow. Pattern diagrams for Meta-Prompting use cases.

**Concerns:** Making architectural patterns understandable without deep system design knowledge. Keeping simulated tool use realistic yet simple enough for the learning platform. Clearly articulating the tradeoffs between different workflow patterns.
