# AI Researcher - Round 2 Pre-Analysis: Lesson Ideas

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI Researcher (AIR)

**Review:** Curriculum structure looks solid. Need to ensure depth in foundational/theoretical aspects linked to practice.

**Initial Lesson Ideas/Abstracts:**

*   **Unit 1: Foundations**
    *   *Lesson 1.1.1: LLM Fundamentals:* Abstract: High-level explanation of Transformers, Attention, Scaling Laws, and emergent capabilities relevant to prompting. Focus on intuition, not deep math. Use analogies.
    *   *Lesson 1.4.1: Understanding Hallucinations & Bias:* Abstract: Define hallucination/bias in LLM context. Show examples (code/text). Discuss root causes (data, architecture). Introduce high-level mitigation ideas (grounding, critical evaluation).
*   **Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft**
    *   *Lesson 2.2.1: Tokenization & Its Impact:* Abstract: Explain BPE/Tokenization process visually. Show how code variables, comments, and non-English text can be tokenized suboptimally. Link directly to potential prompt failures or unexpected behavior in Cursor. Provide workarounds (e.g., character spacing for specific tasks).
*   **Unit 3: Building Complexity & Workflows**
    *   *Lesson 3.1.1: The Science of CoT:* Abstract: Explain *why* CoT works (eliciting latent reasoning steps, intermediate computation). Contrast with direct answering. Show performance gains via research examples (briefly).
    *   *Lesson 3.2.1: Context Windows & RAG Theory:* Abstract: Explain context window limits. Introduce RAG as a method to overcome limits by providing relevant external knowledge. Explain embedding/retrieval concepts at a high level.
    *   *Lesson 3.4.1: Metrics for Evaluating AI Code:** Abstract: Introduce basic code quality metrics (complexity, style adherence) and correctness metrics (unit test pass rates, execution accuracy - pass@k). Discuss limitations of automated metrics vs. human review.
*   **Unit 4: Advanced Techniques & Concepts**
    *   *Lesson 4.1.1: Self-Consistency Explained:* Abstract: Detail the statistical motivation for self-consistency â€“ reducing variance by sampling multiple reasoning paths. Contrast with single CoT.
    *   *Lesson 4.2.1: Agent Architectures Overview:* Abstract: Briefly introduce core concepts of ReAct/Reflexion loops with diagrams. Focus on the role of the LLM/prompt within the loop (planner, reasoner).
    *   *Lesson 4.4.1: Adversarial Prompting Landscape:* Abstract: Define prompt injection, jailbreaking. Show simple examples. Discuss inherent vulnerability and high-level defense ideas (filtering, guardrails, model alignment - brief).
*   **Unit 5: Capstone & Continuous Learning**
    *   *Lesson 5.3.1: Keeping Up with LLM Research:* Abstract: Point to key conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, etc.), arXiv, reputable blogs/researchers to follow for staying current.

**Diagram Idea:** Visualization of tokenization for a code snippet. Diagram comparing CoT vs. direct prompting.
