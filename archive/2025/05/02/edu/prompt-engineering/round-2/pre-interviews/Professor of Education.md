# Interview Transcript: Professor of Education

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Professor of Education (Prof Ed)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**Facilitator:** Your outline focusing on Bloom's taxonomy and learning progression provides a strong pedagogical backbone. Do you foresee challenges in mapping all the technical prompt engineering content neatly onto this structure?

**Prof Ed:** The main challenge isn't mapping, but *assessment*. It's relatively easy to assess Remembering/Understanding (quizzes). Applying is feasible with practical exercises. The difficulty lies in designing scalable, authentic assessments for Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating, especially for 200 engineers. The capstone helps, but formative assessment at higher cognitive levels needs careful design – perhaps structured peer reviews with rubrics, or analysis of complex case studies.

**Facilitator:** Which modules or units seem most demanding cognitively, requiring careful scaffolding?

**Prof Ed:** Unit 3 (Complexity/Workflows) and Unit 4 (Advanced Techniques). Moving from applying single techniques to analyzing workflows (CoT, Chaining) and evaluating outputs requires a significant cognitive jump. Then, understanding abstract concepts like meta-prompting or agent loops (Unit 4) before applying them in the capstone (Unit 5) requires very deliberate scaffolding and likely differentiation.

**Facilitator:** Reflecting on learning complex technical skills yourself, what creates those "Aha!" moments?

**Prof Ed:** For me, it's often seeing a concept applied to solve a problem I've personally struggled with – that makes it relevant (Andragogy). Also, successfully debugging something complex after learning a new technique provides powerful reinforcement. Clear visualizations of abstract processes are also key.

**Facilitator:** Any potential blindspots engineers might bring?

**Prof Ed:** Perhaps focusing solely on the technical execution without developing metacognitive skills – the ability to *reflect* on *why* a prompt worked or failed, and *plan* their approach for the next attempt. We need to explicitly teach and assess this self-reflection (SRL).

**Facilitator:** How do your lesson ideas address the need for authentic assessment and managing cognitive load?

**Prof Ed:** Strength is the structure aligned with cognitive progression. Activities are designed to be practical and build complexity (Scaffolding). Weakness is that designing *good* authentic assessments at scale (Concept #7 from initial brainstorm) is resource-intensive. We need realistic SE tasks for assessments, not just abstract puzzles.

**Facilitator:** Which parts of the curriculum research would you focus on?

**Prof Ed:** Defining SMART learning objectives for all modules (R1 from PM), designing the overall assessment strategy (formative & summative, R4), ensuring pedagogical alignment (scaffolding, Bloom's), designing the capstone structure and rubrics, and potentially instructor/facilitator training approaches (Concept #11 from initial brainstorm).

**Facilitator:** And where should we defer to your expertise during development?

**Prof Ed:** Reviewing lesson plans for pedagogical soundness, designing effective activities and assessments, ensuring appropriate scaffolding and differentiation strategies are built-in.

**Facilitator:** Other SMEs needed for the roadmap discussion?

**Prof Ed:** The current group covers the core areas well. Having PR (Pedagogy Researcher) involved would be valuable for grounding decisions in learning science research.

**Facilitator:** Anything else crucial to consider?

**Prof Ed:** Motivation. How do we keep 200 engineers engaged throughout, especially through challenging modules? We need variety in activities, clear links to job relevance (PO's value prop), and maybe elements of choice or collaboration (Concept #5, #10 from initial brainstorm). Also, the plan for post-course reinforcement (Concept #12) is important for long-term impact.

**Facilitator:** Very helpful, thank you.
