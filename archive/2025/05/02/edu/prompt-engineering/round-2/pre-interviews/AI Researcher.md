# Interview Transcript: AI Researcher

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI Researcher (AIR)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**Facilitator:** Thanks for sharing your lesson ideas, focusing on the theoretical underpinnings. Do you see any challenges in translating these, like the 'Science of CoT' or 'Agent Architectures Overview', into engaging content for engineers without deep AI backgrounds?

**AIR:** The main challenge is abstraction level. We can't delve into research paper complexities. The key is using clear analogies, strong visualizations (as Ed UX suggested), and *immediately* linking the theory to *why* their prompt in Cursor behaves a certain way. For CoT, show a prompt failing, then show CoT succeeding, *then* briefly explain the reasoning-steps concept. For agents, focus on the *prompt's role* in the loop, not the loop implementation itself.

**Facilitator:** Good point on linking. Are there specific modules here you think need the most careful breakdown to manage cognitive load?

**AIR:** Tokenization definitely. It's non-intuitive but explains many strange behaviors, especially with code. It needs visuals and concrete examples of failure. Also, the advanced techniques in Unit 4 – Self-Consistency, Agent Concepts – need to be introduced conceptually first, with very simple examples, before any complex application.

**Facilitator:** Thinking back, what gave you your "Aha!" moments when learning advanced prompting or LLM behavior?

**AIR:** For me, it was understanding *scaling laws* – realizing how much capability simply emerges with model size, which explains why prompting works better on larger models. Also, truly grasping the sequential nature of token generation helped understand *why* CoT or providing clear structure in the prompt influences the output so much. Seeing concrete examples of prompt injection attacks was also eye-opening regarding robustness.

**Facilitator:** Any blindspots engineers might have coming into this?

**AIR:** Treating the LLM like a database or a perfectly logical machine. They need to understand its probabilistic nature, the potential for hallucination, and that it doesn't truly *understand* in a human sense. Also, underestimating the impact of subtle prompt wording changes.

**Facilitator:** Based on your lesson ideas, any particular strengths or weaknesses?

**AIR:** Strength is providing the crucial 'why' which aids deeper understanding and debugging. Weakness is the risk of becoming too academic if not carefully tied to SE practice and Cursor examples. Need strong collaboration with SSE and PE.

**Facilitator:** In the research phase for the curriculum, which areas do you feel most qualified to lead?

**AIR:** Definitely the foundational LLM concepts (Lesson 1.1.1), Tokenization (2.2.1), the theory behind techniques like CoT/Self-Consistency (3.1.1, 4.1.1), RAG theory (3.2.1), Evaluation Metrics (3.4.1), Agent Architectures (4.2.1), and Adversarial Prompting (4.4.1). Also, the future trends/research lesson (5.3.1).

**Facilitator:** And for developing the actual course content and requirements, where should we defer to your expertise?

**AIR:** Similar areas – ensuring the technical accuracy of explanations, defining the appropriate level of theoretical depth, providing context on model limitations, biases, and security vulnerabilities.

**Facilitator:** Any other SMEs crucial for the next group phase where we finalize the roadmaps?

**AIR:** We have a good mix. Perhaps ensuring the PO is present to keep us focused on the overall learning objectives and value prop.

**Facilitator:** Finally, anything important I haven't asked?

**AIR:** Just to re-emphasize the need for a plan to keep theoretical content updated. New architectures, techniques, and understandings emerge constantly. The course needs a mechanism for incorporating significant research breakthroughs, perhaps in the continuous learning module or periodic updates.

**Facilitator:** Excellent points. Thanks for your insights.
