# Interview Transcript: Educational UX Designer

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Educational UX Designer (Ed UX)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**Facilitator:** Thanks, Ed UX. Your focus on learning experience design is crucial. Considering we're teaching complex AI concepts often within the Cursor IDE, what are the biggest UX challenges from an *educational* standpoint?

**Ed UX:** The primary challenge is designing for *active learning* in a potentially constrained environment. How do we embed opportunities for practice, reflection, and feedback seamlessly? Passive consumption of technical info isn't effective. We need interactive elements, perhaps guided tutorials within Cursor (AI UX collab), clear visualizations of abstract concepts (like tokenization or agent loops), and ways for learners to easily compare prompt variations and outcomes. Making the learning *discoverable* and *engaging* within the IDE is key.

**Facilitator:** Which modules pose the greatest cognitive load challenges that require careful educational UX design?

**Ed UX:** Unit 1's foundational concepts (like tokenization) need very clear, visual explanations. Units 3 and 4, with workflows, RAG, and agents, require careful scaffolding. We need to break down these complex processes visually and provide intermediate steps for learners to practice. The transition from understanding individual techniques (Unit 2) to combining them (Unit 3) needs thoughtful design to avoid overwhelming learners.

**Facilitator:** What were your "Aha!" moments related to designing learning experiences for technical skills?

**Ed UX:** Seeing the impact of immediate, contextual feedback – letting learners try something and immediately see the result (and perhaps *why* it worked or didn't). Also, the power of well-designed visualizations to make abstract concepts concrete. And realizing that allowing learners *choice* and control over their path (within limits) significantly boosts engagement.

**Facilitator:** Potential blindspots engineers might have regarding the learning experience itself?

**Ed UX:** Impatience – wanting to jump straight to advanced applications without mastering fundamentals. Difficulty with abstract concepts if not presented visually or with good analogies. Maybe overlooking the importance of metacognitive prompts (as Prof Ed mentioned) – questions that encourage them to reflect on *how* they are learning and problem-solving.

**Facilitator:** How do your lesson ideas contribute?

**Ed UX:** Strength: Focus on learner engagement, visualization, and interactive elements (Lesson 1.0 UX Principles). Ideas for interactive tutorials or simulations. Weakness: Implementation complexity – creating rich interactive experiences, especially integrated into Cursor, requires significant development effort (AI UX input needed).

**Facilitator:** Where can you best contribute during curriculum research?

**Ed UX:** Designing the overall learning flow and user journey, defining requirements for interactive elements and visualizations, ensuring accessibility standards are met, collaborating with Prof Ed/PR on applying learning science principles, user testing learning prototypes.

**Facilitator:** And during development?

**Ed UX:** Creating wireframes/mockups for learning interfaces (both web-based and potential IDE integration), designing specific visualizations and interactive exercises, ensuring consistency in instructional design patterns across modules, usability testing with target learners.

**Facilitator:** Other SMEs needed for roadmapping?

**Ed UX:** AI UX is essential for the in-IDE aspects. Prof Ed/PR provide pedagogical grounding. SSE ensures realism of tasks used in interactive elements.

**Facilitator:** Anything else crucial?

**Ed UX:** We need to consider different learning preferences. Offer variety in how content is presented (text, video, interactive diagrams) and how learners can practice (structured labs, open-ended challenges). Also, how do we facilitate peer learning or discussion within the course structure? (Prof Ed's point on peer review).

**Facilitator:** Excellent points on learner-centric design. Thank you, Ed UX.
