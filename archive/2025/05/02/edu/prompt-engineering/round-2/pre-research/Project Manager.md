**2. Defining Course Requirements & Scope**

2.1. **Research Question:** How to translate the `curriculum.md` and SME inputs into SMART learning objectives and detailed requirements?
2.2. **Research Findings & Guidance (for RAs):**
    *   **SMART Objectives:** Objectives must be **S**pecific (clear action/skill), **M**easurable (observable, assessable criteria), **A**chievable (realistic given resources/time), **R**elevant (aligned with course/job needs), and **T**ime-bound (deadline for mastery). (CTL JHU, DSU Support). Use Bloom's Taxonomy verbs to define cognitive levels (Know Where You Are Going!).
        *   *RA Task:* Systematically review `curriculum.md` and SME outlines, extracting key skills/knowledge. Draft SMART objectives for each module (e.g., "By the end of Unit 2, learners will be able to apply Few-Shot prompting to generate Python code following a provided style guide, as measured by successful completion of Exercise 2.3 with 80% accuracy."). Collaborate with Prof Ed/PR for refinement.
    *   **Instructional Design Requirements:** Documentation should clearly outline target audience, learning objectives, content structure, instructional strategies, assessment methods, technical requirements (e.g., Cursor access), and media needs (eLearning Industry). Treat it like software requirements gathering.
        *   *RA Task:* Research and propose a standard template for instructional design requirements documentation. Populate it based on `curriculum.md` and SME inputs.
    *   **MVP Scope:** Define the core functionality and content essential for initial launch, prioritizing high-impact learning objectives. Defer "nice-to-have" features or advanced modules to later iterations. Common approach in ed tech is to launch core modules first, gather feedback, then enhance (Know Where You Are Going!).
        *   *RA Task:* Analyze drafted objectives and curriculum content to propose an MVP scope (e.g., Units 1-3 + Capstone overview) versus future additions (e.g., deep dives in Unit 4, advanced Capstone options).
2.3. **Development Task Guidance (Core Team):**
    *   Formalize and approve final SMART objectives and requirements documents.
    *   Establish clear MVP scope and manage changes rigorously.

**3. Developing the Project Roadmap & Timeline**

3.1. **Research Question:** What is a realistic, phased roadmap and timeline based on requirements and SME-defined development tasks?
3.2. **Research Findings & Guidance (for RAs):**
    *   **Instructional Design Timelines:** Benchmarks vary greatly depending on complexity and interactivity (Chapman Alliance, SlideShare). Level 2 eLearning (interactive) can take 73-128 hours of development per finished hour of content. A 36-hour blended course could take 90-900 development hours total (SlideShare example). Key phases include Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation (ADDIE/variation) (eLearning Industry).
        *   *RA Task:* Aggregate development tasks from SME outlines (content creation, exercise design, visual aids, platform setup). Research benchmarks for similar technical/blended learning courses. Propose a high-level phased timeline (e.g., Phase 1: Units 1-2 Dev; Phase 2: Unit 3 Dev & Pilot Prep; Phase 3: Pilot & Revisions; Phase 4: Rollout).
    *   **Dependencies & Risks:** Common dependencies include SME availability, content approval cycles, platform readiness, and prerequisite knowledge modules. Risks include scope creep, underestimation of effort, technical issues, SME delays, low learner engagement, and inadequate evaluation (eLearning Industry).
        *   *RA Task:* Map key dependencies between curriculum units and development tasks. Identify potential risks specific to this project (e.g., Cursor API changes, difficulty scaling assessment).
    *   **Effort Estimation:** Use benchmarks (like Chapman Alliance) adjusted for specific content complexity and team expertise. Factor in time for analysis, design, development, reviews, revisions, and project management (eLearning Industry, SlideShare).
        *   *RA Task:* Provide initial effort estimates (e.g., person-days) for major phases based on benchmarks and task aggregation.
3.3. **Development Task Guidance (Core Team):**
    *   Create a detailed project schedule (e.g., Gantt chart) using PM software, incorporating milestones, dependencies, and resource allocation (eLearning Industry).
    *   Implement risk mitigation strategies (e.g., buffer time, contingency plans).
    *   Assign clear ownership for development tasks.

**4. Planning Course Rollout & Logistics**

4.1. **Research Question:** What is the most effective rollout strategy for ~200 engineers?
4.2. **Research Findings & Guidance (for RAs):**
    *   **Rollout Strategies:** For large technical rollouts, **phased rollouts** (by department, region, or cohort) or **pilot groups** are generally preferred over "big bang" to manage support load, gather feedback, and refine the process (TTA, KnowledgeWave). Cascade training (training internal champions/trainers first) can also be effective for scale (Emerald Insight).
        *   *RA Task:* Analyze pros/cons of pilot vs. phased rollout for this audience size and technical nature. Recommend a strategy. Identify potential pilot group criteria.
    *   **Delivery Models:** Given the audience (engineers) and tool focus (Cursor), a **blended learning** approach combining self-paced online modules (for foundational knowledge, flexibility) with optional synchronous sessions (workshops, Q&A, peer collaboration) is common and effective (Microassist, TrainingFolks). Purely self-paced requires high motivation; purely instructor-led is costly at scale.
        *   *RA Task:* Research platforms supporting blended learning (LMS with VILT capabilities, potential Cursor integration points). Outline logistics for the recommended delivery model (scheduling, tech requirements).
    *   **Communication Plan:** Essential for buy-in and smooth execution. Needs pre-launch (awareness, WIIFM - What's In It For Me), launch (instructions, support info), and post-launch phases (reinforcement, feedback collection). Use multichannel approach (email, intranet, team meetings, leadership messaging). Needs clear vision, audience tailoring, and two-way feedback channels (TTA, KnowledgeWave, Microassist).
        *   *RA Task:* Draft a high-level communication plan outlining key messages, channels, audiences, and timing for each phase (pre, launch, post).
4.3. **Development Task Guidance (Core Team):**
    *   Finalize rollout strategy, schedule, and delivery model.
    *   Select/configure required learning platforms (LMS, etc.).
    *   Develop learner support plan (helpdesk, forums, office hours).
    *   Execute the communication plan.

**5. Designing the Course Evaluation Strategy**

5.1. **Research Question:** What metrics and methods should evaluate learner success and course effectiveness?
5.2. **Research Findings & Guidance (for RAs):**
    *   **Evaluation Models:** The **Kirkpatrick Model** is the standard framework (Kirkpatrick Partners, Devlin Peck, Wikipedia):
        *   **Level 1: Reaction:** Learner satisfaction, engagement, perceived relevance (Surveys/"smile sheets"). *Easy but least valuable.*
        *   **Level 2: Learning:** Acquisition of knowledge, skills, confidence (Pre/post tests, quizzes, skill demonstrations, project assessments). *Measures knowledge gain.*
        *   **Level 3: Behavior:** Application of learning on the job (Observations, performance metrics, 360 feedback, project outputs). *Harder but shows transfer.*
        *   **Level 4: Results:** Impact on business/organizational goals (Productivity metrics, code quality, project completion times, innovation rates, potentially ROI). *Hardest but most valuable.*
        *   *RA Task:* Propose specific metrics and data collection methods for each Kirkpatrick level relevant to this course (e.g., L1: post-module survey; L2: capstone project score, quiz results; L3: observation of prompt usage in code reviews, self-reported application; L4: potentially link to team productivity metrics if possible, qualitative feedback on impact). Research the Kirkpatrick Model further.
    *   **Data Collection at Scale:** Use LMS reporting for L1/L2 (surveys, quizzes, completion rates). For L3/L4, consider targeted surveys, manager feedback forms, sampling for observations, or analyzing project metadata (if feasible). Online tools (SurveyMonkey, LMS quizzes) are essential (Devlin Peck).
        *   *RA Task:* Identify specific tools/methods for collecting proposed evaluation data efficiently from ~200 learners.
    *   **ROI/Impact:** Measuring direct ROI for technical training is challenging but desirable. Focus on linking training to key organizational results (Level 4). Qualitative data (interviews, case studies) can supplement quantitative metrics (Devlin Peck, Kirkpatrick Partners). Consider measuring changes in specific engineering metrics potentially influenced by better prompting (e.g., reduction in code churn, faster debugging times).
        *   *RA Task:* Research methods for measuring ROI/impact of software engineering training. Propose feasible L4 metrics or qualitative approaches.
5.3. **Development Task Guidance (Core Team):**
    *   Develop the final evaluation plan, instruments (surveys, assessment rubrics), and data collection schedule.
    *   Establish baseline data where possible (e.g., pre-training skill assessment).
    *   Plan for data analysis and reporting.
    *   Design a feedback loop to incorporate evaluation results into future course iterations.
