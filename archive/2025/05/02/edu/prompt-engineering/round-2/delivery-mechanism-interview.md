**Facilitator:** Welcome everyone. We've all reviewed the initial thoughts on whether to build this course as a VSCode extension or a web app. The goal today is to discuss the trade-offs and ideally reach a consensus, or at least define the path to a decision. Let's start with the core tension: integration versus accessibility. SSE, PE - remind us of the key benefits of building directly into Cursor?

**SSE:** The main thing is authenticity. Developers learn best by doing, right in the tool they use daily. Running prompts, debugging them, seeing the results integrated with code – you can't fully replicate that seamless experience outside the IDE.

**PE:** Agreed. And Cursor specifically offers features we want to leverage – the chat, the diff views for prompt outputs, maybe even custom commands. Building an extension lets us tap into that directly, minimizing context switching which kills flow.

**Facilitator:** Valid points. Now, PM, AIUXE, what are the counterarguments regarding accessibility and user experience?

**PM:** My main concern is reach. Requiring everyone to install and potentially configure Cursor/VSCode limits our audience. What about managers, designers, or less technical folks who could still benefit from the core concepts? A web app is instantly accessible to anyone with a browser.

**AIUXE:** And from a UX perspective, IDEs are inherently complex. Adding a full-blown course risks overwhelming users, especially novices. Cognitive load is a real issue. A dedicated web app allows us to craft a much cleaner, focused learning environment, controlling the interface completely. Plus, building complex, accessible UIs *within* the constraints of VSCode extensions is non-trivial.

**Facilitator:** Pedagogy Researcher, Edu UX – how do you weigh these pedagogical trade-offs? Authenticity versus cognitive load?

**Pedagogy Researcher:** It's a classic Situated Learning vs. Cognitive Load Theory debate. Situated Learning argues for learning in the authentic context of practice (favors extension). Cognitive Load Theory warns against extraneous load that distracts from learning (favors controlled web environment, especially for foundational concepts).

**Edu UX:** I lean towards minimizing extraneous load initially. Unit 1 (Foundations) might be better served by a clean web interface with clear explanations and simple examples. But for Units 2 (Techniques) and 3 (Debugging/Refinement), the authentic practice in the IDE becomes much more critical. Can we have both?

**Facilitator:** That leads perfectly to the hybrid idea. AOA, SSE, what are the technical realities? Is a hybrid feasible? What would it look like?

**AOA:** Feasible, yes. But it's not free. We'd need robust APIs connecting the web platform (for progress, content) to a companion extension (for launching exercises, maybe sending results back). The extension could be more focused – maybe just for specific interactive labs or the capstone.

**SSE:** Right. Instead of building the *entire* course UI in the extension, maybe it just handles the 'do this prompt in Cursor' parts. We could use custom URIs or APIs to launch specific exercises in the IDE from the web app. We'd still need to build and maintain two things, but the extension part becomes less monolithic.

**Facilitator:** What about using VSCode Notebooks within the extension?

**PE:** Notebooks could be great for mixing markdown explanations with executable code/prompt cells. That could be a powerful interactive format within the extension itself, maybe reducing the need for *as much* back-and-forth with a separate web app for some lessons.

**Lead Instructor:** From an instruction standpoint, a hybrid feels right. Deliver theory and basic examples via the web for easy access and focus. Then, for hands-on labs and the capstone, push them into the IDE extension for that crucial real-world practice. The key is making the transition smooth.

**AIUXE:** That seamless transition is critical. Users shouldn't feel like they're juggling two disconnected tools. Clear navigation, state management between the two... it needs careful design.

**PM:** Okay, so hybrid: Web app for core content, accessibility, and simpler interactions. Companion VSCode extension for deep-dive interactive exercises, prompt execution/debugging, and capstone work, possibly using notebooks. Does this capture the consensus?

*(General nods and sounds of agreement)*

**Facilitator:** It seems we have a strong leaning towards this hybrid model. The next step would be to more concretely define the scope of each component – exactly which learning activities belong where – and to perform a technical spike (AOA/SSE) to validate the feasibility of the web-to-extension linking and required VSCode APIs for the interactive elements.

**AOA:** Agreed. We need to de-risk the extension part, confirming we can build the necessary interactive labs before fully committing.

**Facilitator:** Excellent. Thank you all. We'll document this direction and plan the follow-up technical validation.
