# Meeting Report: Prompt Engineering Mastery Course - Delivery Mechanism Synthesis

**Date:** May 4, 2025
**Time:** [Insert Time]
**Meeting Focus:** Synthesis of individual SME interviews and research report to confirm delivery mechanism and define action items.
**Facilitator:** AI Facilitator
**Attendees:** Prompt Engineer (PE), AI Orchestrator-Architect (AOA), Senior Software Engineer (SSE), Project Manager (PM), Product Owner (PO), AI UX Engineer (AIUXE), AI Agent Engineer (AIE), Educational UX Designer (EDUX), AI Researcher (AIR), VSCode Senior Engineer (VSCode SE), VSCode Principal Architect (VSCode PA), Professor of Education (Prof Ed), Pedagogy Researcher (PR).

## 1. Meeting Goal

The primary goal was to synthesize findings from the individual SME interviews (`pre-delivery-interviews/`) and the research synthesis report (`pre-delivery-analysis/research-synthesis-report.md`) to:
1.  Confirm the consensus on the proposed hybrid delivery mechanism.
2.  Identify key technical, pedagogical, UX, and project management considerations arising from this model.
3.  Define concrete action items and owners to move forward with curriculum development.

## 2. Confirmation of Hybrid Delivery Mechanism

*   The meeting began by revisiting the proposed hybrid model:
    *   **Web Application:** For foundational content, course overview, and potentially Unit 1 (Fundamentals).
    *   **VSCode Extension (within Cursor IDE):** For practical application, interactive exercises, and assessments in Units 2-4 and the Capstone Project.
*   There was unanimous agreement among attendees, confirming this hybrid approach as the optimal strategy, balancing accessibility, foundational learning, and situated practical skill development within the target users' primary tool (Cursor).

## 3. Key Discussion Points & Synthesis

*   **Technical Implementation:**
    *   The API between the web application and the VSCode extension is a critical component requiring careful architectural design focused on security, performance, versioning, and minimizing Cursor-specific dependencies (VSCode PA, AOA).
    *   State management and data flow (progress, context, results) across the two platforms need explicit definition (AOA).
    *   A decision is needed on the primary UI technology for the extension's interactive elements: VSCode Notebooks (faster development, less UI flexibility) vs. custom Webviews (more UI control, higher development effort/complexity) (VSCode SE). This impacts timelines.
*   **UX & Pedagogy:**
    *   A seamless user experience transitioning between the web portal and the IDE extension is vital (PO, AIUXE).
    *   The interface design must prioritize accessibility (WCAG AA conformance), especially keyboard navigation and screen reader support within the IDE context (AIUXE).
    *   Instructional design should leverage Multimedia Learning Principles, clear visualizations, contextual help, and interactive exercises native to the IDE (EDUX, AIUXE).
    *   The hybrid model strongly supports Situated Learning and Constructivism principles (Prof Ed, PR).
    *   Cognitive load management (chunking, scaffolding) is crucial (EDUX).
*   **Research & Evaluation:**
    *   The extension enables ecologically valid research and assessment but introduces data privacy challenges (requiring consent/anonymization) (AIR).
    *   Assessment strategies need specific design for the extension environment, focusing on performance-based tasks and robust rubrics (PR, Prof Ed).
    *   Evaluation should follow Kirkpatrick or LTEM frameworks, measuring beyond simple knowledge recall to assess task competence and transfer (PR, AIR).
*   **Curriculum & Content:**
    *   The core curriculum structure (`curriculum.md`) remains sound.
    *   The primary impact of the hybrid decision is on *how* content (especially Units 2-4) is delivered interactively and *how* learning is assessed within the extension (All SMEs). Exercises need to be redesigned to leverage Cursor's specific features (PE, SSE, AIE).
    *   Teaching prompt debugging and AI code review practices within the Cursor context is essential (PE, SSE).
*   **Project Management:**
    *   The hybrid model requires careful planning, likely involving a pilot phase before full rollout to ~200 engineers (PM).
    *   Technical decisions (API, UI tech) are needed promptly to refine the project roadmap and timeline (PM).
    *   The communication plan must clearly articulate the hybrid approach and its benefits (PM).
    *   The MVP scope must ensure a functional and coherent experience across both web and extension components from the start (PO).
