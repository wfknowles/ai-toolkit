# Research Outline: AI Researcher (AIR)

**Thesis Title:** Grounding Prompt Engineering in AI Fundamentals: A Research Plan for Theoretical Accuracy and Conceptual Depth

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a research plan from the AI Researcher (AIR) perspective, ensuring the Prompt Engineering Mastery curriculum (`curriculum.md`) is grounded in accurate AI theory and effectively communicates the underlying principles. Synthesizing AIR inputs from SME discussions (`pre-analysis/`, `pre-interviews/`), it outlines research questions and tasks for RAs focused on the theoretical foundations across all five units. Key areas include determining the appropriate depth and pedagogical methods for foundational LLM concepts (Unit 1), explaining the theory behind core techniques (e.g., tokenization, CoT, RAG, Self-Consistency, Agents - Units 2-4), defining robust evaluation metrics (Unit 3), addressing model limitations, biases, and security (Unit 4 & 5), and planning for future trends and content updates (Unit 5). This research aims to guide the development of content that provides engineers with the crucial 'why' behind prompt engineering, fostering deeper understanding and adaptability.

**4. Evaluation Metrics and Model Limitations (Unit 3.4 & Cross-Cutting)**
    4.1.
