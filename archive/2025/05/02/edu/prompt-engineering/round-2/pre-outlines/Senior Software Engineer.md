# Research Outline: Senior Software Engineer (SSE)

**Thesis Title:** Engineering Relevance: A Research Plan for Grounding Prompt Engineering Mastery Curriculum in Authentic Software Engineering Practice within Cursor

**Abstract:** This paper outlines a research and development plan from the Senior Software Engineer (SSE) perspective, ensuring the Prompt Engineering Mastery course (`curriculum.md`) directly addresses the needs and workflows of its target audience. Drawing from SSE inputs in `pre-analysis/` and `pre-interviews/`, it focuses on identifying high-value SE use cases for prompt engineering techniques across all five units, defining requirements for realistic code examples and exercises within Cursor, shaping the capstone project (Unit 5) for maximum relevance, and investigating practical considerations such as AI output verification and workflow integration. The research tasks aim to provide RAs with clear direction for finding and adapting authentic scenarios, while development tasks focus on building practical, relatable course materials that demonstrably enhance SE productivity and skills.

**Detailed Outline:**

**1. Introduction**
    1.1. Problem Statement: Ensuring prompt engineering training translates into tangible benefits for software engineers in their daily tasks and environment (Cursor).
    1.2. Course Context: Overview of the 5-Unit `curriculum.md` from an SE applicability perspective.
    1.3. Synthesis of Prior Work: Key SSE contributions regarding relevance, habit formation, SE use cases (debugging, code gen, testing, legacy code), verification needs, and workflow integration (`prompt-mastery/...`, `round-2/...`).
    1.4. Thesis Goal: Define R&D tasks to ensure all course units feature authentic SE scenarios, realistic examples, and practical applicability within Cursor.
    1.5. Outline Structure.

**2. Identifying High-Value SE Use Cases (Units 1-4)**
    2.1. Research Question: What specific, common software engineering tasks (across debugging, implementation, testing, documentation, refactoring, etc.) provide the most impactful opportunities for applying the prompting techniques taught in Units 1-4? (Ref: SSE, PE interviews)
    2.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        2.2.1. Survey common workflows and pain points for software engineers (target audience profile).
        2.2.2. Analyze Cursor usage patterns (if possible) or features to identify areas ripe for AI augmentation.
        2.2.3. Map techniques from `curriculum.md` (e.g., CoT, RAG, chaining, agents) to concrete SE problems (e.g., debugging complex bugs, generating test suites for legacy code, explaining unfamiliar APIs, refactoring code to meet new standards).
        2.2.4. Prioritize use cases based on potential impact and feasibility for teaching.
    2.3. Development Tasks:
        2.3.1. Document selected high-value SE use cases to serve as the basis for examples and exercises throughout the course (Lesson 2.4.1, 3.5.1 refinement).
        2.3.2. Ensure a diverse range of SE domains (backend, frontend, testing, etc.) are represented, if applicable to the audience.

**3. Developing Realistic Code Examples & Exercises (Units 1-5)**
    3.1. Research Question: What constitutes a 'realistic' yet pedagogically effective code example or exercise environment for teaching prompt engineering within Cursor to this audience? (Ref: SSE, PE, Prof Ed interviews)
    3.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        3.2.1. Identify representative code snippets, structures, and complexities relevant to the target engineers' work.
        3.2.2. Research sources of open-source code or realistic internal code samples (anonymized if necessary) suitable for course use.
        3.2.3. Analyze requirements for setting up self-contained exercise environments within Cursor (dependencies, project structure).
    3.3. Development Tasks:
        3.3.1. Create or adapt codebases/snippets for use in all course examples and hands-on labs.
        3.3.2. Ensure examples are varied but avoid unnecessary complexity unrelated to the prompting technique being taught.
        3.3.3. Develop clear instructions for setting up and navigating exercise environments within Cursor.

**4. Defining an Authentic Capstone Project (Unit 5)**
    4.1. Research Question: What type of capstone project allows engineers to realistically synthesize and apply the learned prompt engineering techniques (Units 1-4) to a significant, authentic SE challenge within Cursor? (Ref: SSE, Prof Ed, AOA interviews)
    4.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        4.2.1. Brainstorm potential capstone project themes aligned with high-value SE use cases (from Sec 2).
        4.2.2. Research existing AI/SE project-based learning examples.
        4.2.3. Define criteria for a successful capstone project (complexity, scope, application of techniques, realism).
    4.3. Development Tasks:
        4.3.1. Define 2-3 potential capstone project options with clear goals, requirements, and deliverables.
        4.3.2. Develop starter code, project setup instructions, and evaluation rubrics for the capstone (Coord with Prof Ed).
        4.3.3. Ensure capstone necessitates using Cursor and integrates multiple techniques from the course.

**5. Addressing Practical SE Concerns (Cross-Cutting)**
    5.1. Research Question: How should the curriculum address practical engineer concerns like verifying AI-generated code/output, integrating prompting into team workflows (e.g., code review of prompts), and knowing when *not* to use AI? (Ref: SSE interview)
    5.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        5.2.1. Research best practices and techniques for reviewing and validating LLM-generated code.
        5.2.2. Investigate potential models for incorporating prompt review into standard code review processes.
        5.2.3. Collect heuristics or guidelines on when traditional SE methods might be superior to AI assistance.
    5.3. Development Tasks:
        5.3.1. Integrate lessons or modules on critical evaluation of AI output (potential addition to Unit 3 or 5).
        5.3.2. Include discussion points or short exercises on workflow integration.
        5.3.3. Develop guidelines on appropriate use-cases (part of introduction or ethics module).

**6. Conclusion & Next Steps**
    6.1. Summary of Research Questions and Development Tasks for SE Relevance.
    6.2. Dependencies (PE for techniques, AOA/AAE for advanced examples, AI UX for Cursor integration, Prof Ed for assessment).
    6.3. Call for feedback on realism and priorities.
