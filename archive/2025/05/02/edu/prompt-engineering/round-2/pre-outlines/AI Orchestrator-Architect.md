**Thesis Title:** Architecting Learning for Complexity: Research Plan for Teaching Prompt Chaining, RAG Integration, and Agentic Patterns in Software Engineering

**Abstract:** This paper details a research plan for Units 3 and 4 of the Prompt Engineering Mastery curriculum, focusing on prompt chaining, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integration, and introductory agentic architectures. Synthesizing AOA perspectives from SME discussions and interviews (`pre-analysis/`, `pre-interviews/`) alongside the defined `curriculum.md`, it outlines research questions and tasks for RAs. The core focus is on determining effective pedagogical strategies and development requirements for teaching engineers how to design, implement (conceptually), and evaluate robust, efficient, and scalable prompt-based workflows within the Cursor environment. Key areas include managing complexity in chains, effective RAG patterns, conceptualizing agent loops (Plan-Act-Observe), error handling, state management, security considerations, and performance/cost implications. This research aims to inform the development of clear, practical, and architecturally sound learning modules for advanced prompt engineering concepts.

**Detailed Outline:**

**1. Introduction**
    1.1. Problem Statement: The challenge of teaching complex, multi-step AI workflow concepts (chaining, RAG, agents) to software engineers.
    1.2. Course Context: Overview of `curriculum.md`, focusing on Units 3 (Complexity/Workflows) and 4 (Advanced Techniques).
    1.3. Synthesis of Prior Work: Key AOA contributions and related points from SMEs regarding workflow complexity, robustness, visualization needs, and agent concepts (`prompt-mastery/...`, `round-2/...`).
    1.4. Thesis Goal: Define research plan for RAs concerning pedagogical approaches and development needs for Units 3 & 4, emphasizing architectural soundness, robustness, and efficiency.
    1.5. Outline Structure.

**2. Prompt Chaining (Unit 3.3)**
    2.1. Research Question: What are the most effective ways to teach engineers principles of designing robust prompt chains, including state management, error handling, and structured input/output, within the Cursor context? (Ref: AOA, PE, SSE interviews)
    2.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        2.2.1. Analyze common patterns and anti-patterns in prompt chaining from literature and practice.
        2.2.2. Research techniques for state management between LLM calls in simple workflow scenarios suitable for Cursor/scripting.
        2.2.3. Investigate error handling strategies (e.g., retry mechanisms, fallback prompts, validation) applicable to chained prompts.
        2.2.4. Identify optimal structured data formats (e.g., JSON schema) for reliable input/output between chain steps.
    2.3. Development Tasks:
        2.3.1. Design exercises demonstrating robust chain construction, including error handling and state passing (Lesson 3.3.1, 3.3.2).
        2.3.2. Develop visual aids or simplified diagrams explaining chain execution flow (Coord with Ed UX).
        2.3.3. Create templates for structured input/output prompts.

**3. RAG Integration Patterns (Unit 3.2)**
    3.1. Research Question: How can the course effectively teach the *concept* and *application* of RAG for grounding LLMs and overcoming context limits in SE tasks (e.g., codebase Q&A) without requiring deep vector DB knowledge? (Ref: AOA, PE, AIR interviews)
    3.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        3.2.1. Survey different conceptual models for explaining RAG (prompt augmentation focus).
        3.2.2. Identify high-level RAG integration patterns suitable for demonstration within Cursor (e.g., using search results, document snippets).
        3.2.3. Research evaluation methods for RAG effectiveness (relevance, grounding) suitable for course exercises.
    3.3. Development Tasks:
        3.3.1. Develop conceptual explanations and diagrams of the RAG process (Coord with Ed UX, AIR).
        3.3.2. Create exercises where learners use provided context (simulating RAG retrieval) to augment prompts for specific SE tasks (Lesson 3.2.1).
        3.3.3. Design simple scenarios demonstrating RAG benefits (e.g., answering questions about a larger code context than fits in the prompt window).

**4. Introduction to Agentic Patterns (Unit 4.2)**
    4.1. Research Question: What is the most effective pedagogical approach to introduce the core concepts of agentic loops (e.g., Plan-Act-Observe, ReAct) and the role of prompting in driving agent behavior, using Cursor/scripts as the context? (Ref: AOA, AAE, AIR interviews)
    4.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        4.2.1. Review literature on introductory AI agent concepts and simple frameworks (ReAct, basic loops).
        4.2.2. Identify simple, illustrative SE tasks suitable for demonstrating basic agentic patterns (e.g., iterative code refinement based on feedback).
        4.2.3. Research methods for visualizing agent loops and decision-making processes (Ref: Ed UX interview).
        4.2.4. Investigate prompting techniques for agent planning, tool description, and self-correction at a basic level.
    4.3. Development Tasks:
        4.3.1. Create clear conceptual explanations and visualizations of a simple agent loop (Lesson 4.2.1) (Coord with Ed UX, AAE).
        4.3.2. Develop guided exercises where learners write prompts to control steps within a pre-defined simple agent structure (executed via script or simulated in Cursor).
        4.3.3. Provide examples of planning prompts and tool use prompts for simple scenarios.

**5. Cross-Cutting Architectural Concerns (Units 3 & 4)**
    5.1. Research Question: How should the curriculum address non-functional requirements like performance/latency, cost efficiency, and security considerations (e.g., prompt injection in chains/agents) for complex workflows? (Ref: AOA, AAE interviews, Curriculum 4.4.1)
    5.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        5.2.1. Research basic methods for estimating token usage and latency in chained/agentic workflows.
        5.2.2. Identify common security vulnerabilities associated with multi-step prompt systems and basic mitigation strategies.
        5.2.3. Collate best practices for designing efficient (less computationally expensive) workflows where applicable.

        5.3.1. Integrate discussions of cost, latency, and security into relevant lessons in Units 3 & 4.
        5.3.2. Develop simple calculator tools or guidelines for estimating workflow costs.
        5.3.3. Include examples or warnings about potential security pitfalls in exercises.
