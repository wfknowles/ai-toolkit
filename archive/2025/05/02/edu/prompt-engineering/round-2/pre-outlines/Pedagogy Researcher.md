**Thesis Title:** Evidence-Based Pedagogy for Prompt Engineering: A Learning Science Research Plan for Instructional Strategies and Evaluation

**Abstract:** This paper presents a research plan from the Pedagogy Researcher (PR) perspective, ensuring the Prompt Engineering Mastery course (`curriculum.md`) is built upon evidence-based learning science principles. Complementing the Prof Ed outline, this plan synthesizes PR insights from SME interviews (`pre-analysis/`, `pre-interviews/`) and learning science literature to define research questions and tasks for RAs. Key areas include applying specific theories (Cognitive Load Theory, Constructivism, Situated Learning) to instructional design, investigating effective strategies for promoting knowledge transfer, metacognition (SRL), and managing cognitive demands (Units 3 & 4), researching optimal feedback mechanisms, and contributing a learning science perspective to the course evaluation framework. This research aims to guide the development of instructional strategies and evaluation methods that are demonstrably effective based on how people learn complex technical skills.

**1. Introduction**
    1.1. Problem Statement: Ensuring the instructional design of the prompt engineering course leverages learning science for optimal effectiveness, transfer, and engagement.
    1.2. Course Context: Overview of the 5-Unit `curriculum.md` from a learning science lens.
    1.3. Synthesis of Prior Work: Key PR contributions regarding transfer challenges, cognitive load management, metacognition (SRL), scalability issues, relevant theories (CLT, Constructivism, Situated Learning), and course evaluation needs (`prompt-mastery/...`, `round-2/...`).
    1.4. Thesis Goal: Define R&D tasks to ground instructional strategies and evaluation methods in learning science research.
    1.5. Outline Structure.

**2. Applying Learning Theories to Instructional Design**
    2.1. Research Question: How can principles from Cognitive Load Theory, Constructivism, and Situated Learning be practically applied to design specific lessons, activities, and interactions throughout the course? (Ref: PR, Prof Ed, Ed UX interviews)
    2.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        2.2.1. Conduct focused literature reviews on applying CLT (managing intrinsic/extraneous/germane load), Constructivism (active knowledge building), and Situated Learning (authentic context) in technical training.
        2.2.2. Analyze specific course modules (esp. Units 3 & 4) through the lens of these theories to identify design opportunities and potential pitfalls.
        2.2.3. Research evidence-based instructional strategies derived from these theories (e.g., worked examples, inquiry-based learning, collaborative problem-solving).
    2.3. Development Tasks:
        2.3.1. Provide specific recommendations for instructional strategies for each module based on learning science principles (Coord with Prof Ed, Ed UX).
        2.3.2. Review developed lesson plans and activities for alignment with these theories.
        2.3.3. Advise on balancing direct instruction with constructivist activities.

**3. Fostering Knowledge Transfer**
    3.1. Research Question: What instructional design features and assessment methods best promote the transfer of prompt engineering skills learned in the course to novel problems and diverse real-world software engineering contexts? (Ref: PR interview emphasis on Transfer)
    3.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        3.2.1. Research learning science literature on factors influencing knowledge transfer (e.g., varied practice, explicit bridging, metacognitive awareness).
        3.2.2. Investigate methods for designing practice activities that require learners to adapt techniques to slightly different scenarios (near transfer) or new contexts (far transfer).
        3.2.3. Analyze how the capstone project (Unit 5) can be optimized to assess far transfer.
    3.3. Development Tasks:
        3.3.1. Design varied practice exercises across modules that require adaptation, not just repetition.
        3.3.2. Incorporate explicit prompts or activities that ask learners to connect course concepts to their own work contexts.
        3.3.3. Ensure capstone assessment specifically targets and measures skill transfer (Coord with Prof Ed, SSE).

**4. Enhancing Metacognition (SRL)**
    4.1. Research Question: What specific, evidence-based techniques can be embedded within the course structure and activities to effectively promote self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, such as planning, monitoring, and evaluating one's own prompting process? (Ref: PR, Prof Ed interviews)
    4.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        4.2.1. Review research on fostering SRL in online and technical learning environments.
        4.2.2. Identify specific SRL strategies relevant to prompt engineering (e.g., goal setting for prompt quality, self-monitoring success/failure, strategy adjustment).
        4.2.3. Investigate tools or techniques for prompting reflection (e.g., guided questions, learning journals, wrappers).
    4.3. Development Tasks:
        4.3.1. Design specific metacognitive prompts or reflective activities integrated into lessons or exercises (Coord with Prof Ed, Ed UX).
        4.3.2. Develop guidelines for learners on how to approach the iterative, self-reflective nature of prompt engineering.
        4.3.3. Potentially design self-assessment tools related to SRL skills.

**5. Optimizing Feedback Mechanisms**
    5.1. Research Question: Based on learning science principles, what types and timing of feedback (e.g., immediate/delayed, automated/peer/instructor, explanatory/corrective) are most effective for supporting learning in different parts of the course (e.g., foundational concepts vs. complex application)? (Ref: PR interview on feedback)
    5.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        5.2.1. Research literature on effective feedback in education, particularly for complex skills.
        5.2.2. Analyze the types of tasks in the curriculum and determine the most appropriate feedback strategy for each.
        5.2.3. Investigate the potential and limitations of automated feedback for prompt quality or code output within the Cursor environment (Coord with AI UX, PE).
    5.3. Development Tasks:
        5.3.1. Define the feedback strategy for different assessment types (quizzes, labs, peer review, capstone).
        5.3.2. Design the content and format of feedback provided (e.g., structure for peer review feedback).
        5.3.3. Advise on the implementation of feedback mechanisms within the learning platform/IDE (Coord with AI UX, Ed UX).

**6. Contributing to Course Evaluation Framework**
    6.1. Research Question: From a learning science perspective, what instruments and data collection methods are needed to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of the course in terms of learning outcomes, engagement, transfer, and learner self-efficacy? (Ref: PR interview emphasis on Course Evaluation)
    6.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        6.2.1. Research validated instruments for measuring learning, engagement, self-efficacy, and potentially SRL in educational settings.
        6.2.2. Identify methodologies for assessing knowledge transfer beyond course completion (e.g., follow-up surveys, performance observation - if feasible).
        6.2.3. Advise on data analysis techniques appropriate for educational evaluation.
    6.3. Development Tasks:
        6.3.1. Collaborate with PM and Prof Ed on the final course evaluation plan.
