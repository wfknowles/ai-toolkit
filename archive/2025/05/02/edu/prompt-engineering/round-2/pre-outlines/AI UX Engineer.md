**Thesis Title:** Designing the In-IDE Learning Experience: A Research Plan for Effective AI Interaction Pedagogy within Cursor

**Abstract:** This paper outlines a research plan centered on the User Experience (UX) of learning prompt engineering directly within the Cursor IDE, as proposed in the Prompt Engineering Mastery curriculum (`curriculum.md`). Integrating AI UX perspectives from SME discussions (`pre-analysis/`, `pre-interviews/`), it defines research questions and tasks for RAs focused on optimizing the interaction design for learning. Key areas include investigating best practices for contextual help and examples (Lesson 2.4.1), effective UI patterns for managing context (`@`-files, chat history), methods for visualizing complex prompts/workflows (Units 3 & 4), designing intuitive feedback mechanisms, exploring the UX of prompt iteration and debugging within the tool, and ensuring accessibility. This research aims to inform the development of seamless, engaging, and effective learning interactions integrated directly into the engineers' primary development environment.

**Detailed Outline:**

**1. Introduction**
    1.1. Problem Statement: The unique UX challenges and opportunities of teaching prompt engineering within an integrated development environment (Cursor).
    1.2. Course Context: Overview of `curriculum.md` with emphasis on the Cursor-centric nature of exercises and application.
    1.3. Synthesis of Prior Work: Key AI UX points regarding balancing instruction/workflow, context management complexity, visualization needs, feedback importance, iteration, and accessibility (`prompt-mastery/...`, `round-2/...`).
    1.4. Thesis Goal: Define R&D tasks to ensure the in-Cursor learning experience is intuitive, effective, and enhances skill acquisition.
    1.5. Outline Structure.

**2. Interaction Design for Core Concepts & Practice (Units 1 & 2)**
    2.1. Research Question: What are the most effective UI/UX patterns within Cursor for presenting foundational concepts (Unit 1), demonstrating core techniques (Unit 2), and enabling hands-on practice without disrupting the coding workflow? (Ref: AI UX, Ed UX interviews)

        3.3.2. Develop visual cues or feedback mechanisms within Cursor (if feasible) to indicate the context being used by the AI.

**4. Visualizing Complex Prompts & Workflows (Units 3 & 4)**
    4.1. Research Question: What visualization techniques, potentially integrated within Cursor or supplementary materials, can effectively help engineers understand the structure and flow of complex prompts, chains, RAG processes, and agent loops? (Ref: AI UX, Ed UX, AOA interviews)

    5.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        5.2.1. Research UX best practices for displaying AI responses (code diffs, explanations) and enabling easy refinement.
