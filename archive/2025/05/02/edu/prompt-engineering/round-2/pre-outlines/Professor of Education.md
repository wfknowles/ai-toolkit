**Thesis Title:** Pedagogical Foundations for Prompt Engineering Mastery: A Research Plan for Assessment, Scaffolding, and Higher-Order Thinking

**Abstract:** This paper details a research plan from the Professor of Education perspective, focused on establishing a robust pedagogical framework for the Prompt Engineering Mastery course (`curriculum.md`). Synthesizing insights from educational theory and SME interviews (`pre-analysis/`, `pre-interviews/`), particularly regarding assessment challenges and cognitive progression, it outlines research questions and tasks for RAs. Key areas include designing a comprehensive and scalable assessment strategy (formative and summative) aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy, developing effective scaffolding techniques for complex topics (Units 3 & 4), defining requirements for the capstone project (Unit 5) to measure higher-order skills (Analysis, Evaluation, Creation), and ensuring instructional strategies promote metacognition and deep learning. This research aims to inform the development of a curriculum that is not only technically accurate but also pedagogically sound and effective for adult learners in an engineering context.

**2. Designing a Scalable and Authentic Assessment Strategy (Units 1-5)**
    2.1. Research Question: What combination of formative and summative assessment methods can effectively, authentically, and scalably measure engineers' achievement of learning objectives across different cognitive levels (Remembering to Creating) for all five units? (Ref: Prof Ed, PR interviews, PM R4)
    2.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        2.2.1. Review literature on assessment methods in technical/engineering education and online learning (e.g., performance-based assessment, automated grading, peer assessment, portfolio assessment).
        2.2.2. Analyze the SMART learning objectives (from PM research) to determine appropriate assessment methods for each.
        2.2.3. Investigate strategies for designing authentic assessment tasks that mirror real-world SE prompting scenarios (Coord with SSE).
        2.2.4. Research best practices and tools for implementing peer assessment with rubrics at scale.
        2.2.5. Explore feasibility of automated feedback/grading for specific exercise types.
    2.3. Development Tasks:
        2.3.1. Design specific formative assessment activities for each module (e.g., quizzes, short exercises, peer reviews).
        2.3.2. Develop summative assessments for each unit, including the capstone (Unit 5).
        2.3.3. Create detailed rubrics for all performance-based assessments and peer reviews.
        2.3.4. Define the overall grading scheme and assessment workflow.

**3. Scaffolding Complex Concepts and Skills (Units 3 & 4)**
    3.1. Research Question: What specific instructional scaffolding techniques are most appropriate for supporting learners as they progress from basic prompt techniques (Unit 2) to complex workflows (Unit 3) and abstract agentic/advanced concepts (Unit 4)? (Ref: Prof Ed, PR, Ed UX, AOA interviews)
    3.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        3.2.1. Research various scaffolding models (e.g., fading, contingency, task decomposition) applicable to technical skill acquisition.
        3.2.2. Analyze the specific cognitive jumps required in Units 3 & 4 (e.g., synthesis, abstraction) and identify targeted scaffolding needs.
        3.2.3. Investigate the role of worked examples, templates, and guided practice in reducing cognitive load for complex tasks.
    3.3. Development Tasks:
        3.3.1. Design the sequence of activities within Units 3 & 4 to provide gradual increase in complexity.
        3.3.2. Develop worked examples and partially completed solutions for complex techniques (e.g., chaining, RAG, agents).
        3.3.3. Create templates or structured guides for exercises involving complex workflows.
        3.3.4. Ensure clear links and build-up from foundational units.

**4. Designing the Capstone Project for Higher-Order Thinking (Unit 5)**
    4.1. Research Question: How should the Unit 5 capstone project be designed to effectively assess engineers' ability to Analyze complex problems, Evaluate different prompting strategies, and Create novel or effective solutions using the techniques learned throughout the course? (Ref: Prof Ed, SSE, AOA interviews)
    4.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        4.2.1. Apply Bloom's Taxonomy (Analyze, Evaluate, Create levels) to define specific assessment goals for the capstone.
        4.2.2. Research best practices for designing capstone projects in engineering education that promote synthesis and creativity.
        4.2.3. Collaborate with SSE/AOA/AAE to ensure project options are technically meaningful and require integration of multiple skills.
    4.3. Development Tasks:
        4.3.1. Refine capstone project options (from SSE Dev Tasks) based on pedagogical goals.
        4.3.2. Develop detailed capstone assessment rubrics focusing on higher-order thinking skills, justification of choices, and solution effectiveness.
        4.3.3. Design the process for project submission, review, and feedback.

**5. Fostering Metacognition and Motivation (Cross-Cutting)**
    5.1. Research Question: What pedagogical strategies and course design elements can effectively encourage engineers to develop metacognitive skills (self-reflection, planning - SRL) related to prompt engineering and maintain motivation throughout the course? (Ref: Prof Ed, PR, Ed UX interviews)
    5.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        5.2.1. Research techniques for explicitly teaching and prompting metacognitive reflection in online learning.
        5.2.2. Investigate motivational theories (e.g., ARCS model) and their application in adult technical training.
        5.2.3. Explore the role of choice, collaboration, and clear relevance (Andragogy) in boosting motivation.
    5.3. Development Tasks:
        5.3.1. Integrate specific reflective prompts or activities into lessons (Coord with Ed UX).
        5.3.2. Design course elements that offer learner choice where appropriate (e.g., project options, optional deep dives).
        5.3.3. Ensure clear communication of learning objectives and relevance to SE work throughout the course (Coord with PM, SSE).
        5.3.4. Incorporate elements of variety and engagement in activities (Coord with Ed UX).
