# Research Outline: Prompt Engineer (PE)

**Thesis Title:** From Theory to Practice: Actionable Research & Development for Teaching Core Prompt Engineering Techniques to Software Engineers via Cursor

**Abstract:** This paper outlines a research and development plan focused on operationalizing the practical prompt engineering techniques identified in Units 1-3 of the proposed curriculum (`curriculum.md`). It synthesizes insights from SME pre-analysis and interviews (`pre-analysis/`, `pre-interviews/`) to define research questions and development tasks necessary for creating effective, hands-on learning experiences within the Cursor IDE. Key areas include pedagogical approaches for foundational concepts (e.g., tokenization), designing effective exercises for core techniques (e.g., few-shot, CoT, RAG basics), developing robust debugging strategies for prompts, and ensuring seamless integration and realistic application within typical software engineering workflows supported by Cursor. The goal is to provide actionable guidance for research assistants and developers building the course materials, ensuring practical skill acquisition and immediate applicability for the target audience of ~200 software engineers.

**Detailed Outline:**

**1. Introduction**
    1.1. Problem Statement: The need for effective, scalable prompt engineering training tailored to software engineers using Cursor.
    1.2. Course Context: Brief overview of the 5-Unit curriculum structure (`curriculum.md`) and the specific focus of this research plan (Units 1-3 practical techniques).
    1.3. Synthesis of Prior Work: Key takeaways from `prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`, `prompt-mastery/sme-group-interview.md`, `round-2/pre-analysis`, and `round-2/pre-interviews` relevant to teaching practical techniques (e.g., PE focus on demos, SSE focus on SE tasks, AIR on 'why', AOA on workflows).
    1.4. Thesis Goal: Define research questions and development tasks for Units 1-3 content, focusing on pedagogy, practical exercises, debugging, and Cursor integration.
    1.5. Outline Structure.

**2. Pedagogical Approaches for Foundational Concepts (Unit 1 & 2)**
    2.1. Research Question: What are the most effective methods (analogies, visualizations, interactive exercises) to teach non-intuitive concepts like tokenization (Lesson 1.1.1, 2.2.1) and the probabilistic nature of LLMs (Lesson 1.1.2) to engineers within Cursor? (Ref: AIR, PE interviews)
    2.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        2.2.1. Literature review on teaching abstract technical concepts.
        2.2.2. Identify and evaluate existing visualizations/tools for tokenization.
        2.2.3. Survey potential analogies relevant to SE backgrounds.
    2.3. Development Tasks:
        2.3.1. Design interactive mini-exercises demonstrating tokenization impact in Cursor.
        2.3.2. Develop clear, concise explanations and analogies for core LLM behaviors.

**3. Designing Effective Exercises for Core Techniques (Unit 2 & 3)**
    3.1. Research Question: What types of practical exercises within Cursor best facilitate mastery of core techniques like few-shot prompting (2.1.1), role prompting (2.1.1), Chain-of-Thought (3.1.1), and basic RAG concepts (3.2.1)? (Ref: PE, SSE, AOA, Prof Ed interviews)
    3.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        3.2.1. Identify common SE tasks suitable for applying these techniques (Ref: SSE interview, `prompt-mastery/pre-analysis`).
        3.2.2. Analyze existing prompt engineering tutorials/courses for exercise patterns.
        3.2.3. Research methods for scaffolding exercises from simple application to more complex problem-solving.
    3.3. Development Tasks:
        3.3.1. Develop specific, realistic SE-focused lab scenarios within Cursor for each core technique (e.g., using few-shot for code formatting, CoT for debugging logic, RAG for querying codebase).
        3.3.2. Create sample solutions and evaluation rubrics/criteria for exercises (Ref: Prof Ed interview).
        3.3.3. Design templates or starting points within Cursor to guide learners.

**4. Developing Prompt Debugging Pedagogy (Cross-Cutting)**
    4.1. Research Question: What is a systematic, teachable methodology for engineers to debug failing or suboptimal prompts within the Cursor environment? (Ref: PE interview emphasis)
    4.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        4.2.1. Catalog common failure modes of prompts in SE contexts.
        4.2.2. Research debugging techniques from traditional programming and adapt them to prompting (e.g., simplification, input isolation, parameter tweaking).
        4.2.3. Investigate how Cursor's features (e.g., history, diff views) can support prompt debugging.
    4.3. Development Tasks:
        4.3.1. Create a dedicated lesson or module section on prompt debugging strategies (potential addition to Unit 2 or 3).
        4.3.2. Develop exercises specifically focused on diagnosing and fixing faulty prompts.
        4.3.3. Document best practices for using Cursor features during debugging.

**5. Cursor Integration and Workflow Application (Unit 2 & 3)**
    5.1. Research Question: How can the course effectively demonstrate and encourage the integration of these prompting techniques into standard SE workflows (debugging, code gen, testing, documentation) using Cursor's features (`@`-files, context management)? (Ref: SSE, AI UX interviews)
    5.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        5.2.1. Map specific prompting techniques to stages in the software development lifecycle.
        5.2.2. Analyze Cursor's context management features (`@`-files, symbols) for optimal use with different techniques.
        5.2.3. Research best practices for prompt versioning and sharing within teams (potential future topic).
    5.3. Development Tasks:
        5.3.1. Ensure all exercises and examples are implemented directly within Cursor, using realistic codebases/scenarios.
        5.3.2. Develop specific guidance/tutorials on effective context management in Cursor for prompting (Lesson 2.4.1 refinement).
        5.3.3. Create examples demonstrating end-to-end SE tasks augmented by prompting (e.g., debugging -> fixing -> testing -> documenting with AI assistance).

**6. Conclusion & Next Steps**

    6.2. Dependencies and Collaboration points (e.g., with AIR for theory, SSE for SE tasks, AI UX/Ed UX for interface/visuals).
