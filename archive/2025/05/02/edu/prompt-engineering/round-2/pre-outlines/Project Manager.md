# Research Outline: Project Manager (PM)

**Thesis Title:** Project Blueprint for Prompt Engineering Mastery: A Research Plan for Curriculum Development, Rollout, and Evaluation

**Abstract:** This paper presents a project management research plan for the Prompt Engineering Mastery course initiative. Leveraging the established `curriculum.md` and insights from SME contributions (`pre-analysis/`, `pre-interviews/`), this outline focuses on defining the necessary research to establish clear project requirements, development roadmaps, rollout strategies, and evaluation frameworks. Research tasks for RAs will cover areas such as defining SMART learning objectives (refining R1), establishing project scope and timelines, identifying resource requirements, planning communication and stakeholder management, designing the course evaluation strategy (refining R4), and developing a phased rollout plan for the ~200 engineer audience. The goal is to provide a comprehensive project management foundation to guide the research assistants and the core team towards successful course development and deployment.

**Detailed Outline:**

**1. Introduction**
    1.1. Project Goal: Successfully develop and deploy a high-impact Prompt Engineering Mastery course for ~200 software engineers.
    1.2. Course Context: Overview of `curriculum.md` and the project scope implied by previous rounds.
    1.3. Synthesis of Prior Work: Key PM requirements from initial brainstorm (R1, R4) and relevant logistical/planning points raised by SMEs in `prompt-mastery/...` and `round-2/...` (e.g., Prof Ed on assessment scaling, PR on course evaluation, AIR on updates).
    1.4. Thesis Goal: Define research tasks required to build a comprehensive project plan, including requirements, roadmap, rollout, and evaluation.
    1.5. Outline Structure.

**2. Defining Course Requirements & Scope**
    2.1. Research Question: How can we translate the 5-unit `curriculum.md` and SME inputs into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) learning objectives and detailed functional/non-functional requirements for the course materials and platform? (Ref: PM R1, Prof Ed interview)
    2.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        2.2.1. Systematically review `curriculum.md` and all SME outlines (`pre-outlines/`) to extract explicit and implicit requirements.
        2.2.2. Draft SMART learning objectives for each module in collaboration with pedagogical SMEs (Prof Ed, PR).
        2.2.3. Research best practices for requirements documentation for educational projects.
        2.2.4. Identify Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope vs. future enhancements.
    2.3. Development Tasks (Implied for Core Team):
        2.3.1. Formalize and document final course requirements and learning objectives.
        2.3.2. Establish scope boundaries and manage scope creep throughout the project.

**3. Developing the Project Roadmap & Timeline**
    3.1. Research Question: Based on the defined requirements and the development tasks outlined by technical and pedagogical SMEs, what is a realistic, phased roadmap and timeline for curriculum research, development, testing, and rollout? (Ref: All SME outlines implicitly define dev tasks)
    3.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        3.2.1. Aggregate all development tasks identified in the SME `pre-outlines/`.
        3.2.2. Research standard timelines for instructional design and technical course development.
        3.2.3. Identify key milestones, dependencies between tasks (e.g., foundational content before advanced), and potential risks/bottlenecks.
        3.2.4. Estimate effort/resource needs for major development phases (content creation, platform integration, testing).
    3.3. Development Tasks (Implied for Core Team):
        3.3.1. Create a detailed project schedule with milestones and deliverables.
        3.3.2. Assign owners/teams to development tasks.
        3.3.3. Implement risk management strategies.

**4. Planning Course Rollout & Logistics**
    4.1. Research Question: What is the most effective rollout strategy (e.g., pilot group, phased rollout, big bang) for delivering the course to ~200 engineers, considering factors like scheduling, support, and communication? (Ref: Initial prompt, Prof Ed concerns on scale)
    4.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        4.2.1. Research best practices for large-scale training program rollouts in corporate environments.
        4.2.2. Analyze different delivery models (e.g., self-paced online, blended, instructor-led workshops) and their logistical implications.
        4.2.3. Identify requirements for learning platform(s) (LMS, potential Cursor integration).
        4.2.4. Draft a communication plan for pre-launch, launch, and post-launch phases.
    4.3. Development Tasks (Implied for Core Team):
        4.3.1. Finalize the rollout strategy and schedule.
        4.3.2. Secure necessary platform/tools.
        4.3.3. Develop support plan for learners during the course.
        4.3.4. Execute communication plan.

**5. Designing the Course Evaluation Strategy**
    5.1. Research Question: What metrics and methods should be used to evaluate both learner success (knowledge/skill acquisition, application) and overall course effectiveness (engagement, impact, ROI)? (Ref: PM R4, Prof Ed, PR interviews)
    5.2. Research Tasks (for RAs):
        5.2.1. Research established models for training evaluation (e.g., Kirkpatrick Model).
        5.2.2. Identify specific, measurable metrics for learner assessment (aligned with SMART objectives) and course feedback (e.g., completion rates, satisfaction surveys, pre/post assessments, on-the-job application metrics).
        5.2.3. Investigate methods for collecting evaluation data at scale.
        5.2.4. Research approaches for measuring long-term impact and potential ROI (e.g., productivity improvements).
    5.3. Development Tasks (Implied for Core Team):
        5.3.1. Develop the final evaluation plan, including instruments (surveys, assessments) and data collection schedule.
        5.3.2. Establish baseline metrics where possible.
        5.3.3. Plan for analysis and reporting of evaluation results.
        5.3.4. Design process for incorporating feedback into future course iterations (Ref: PR, AIR interviews).
