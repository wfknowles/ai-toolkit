**AI Facilitator:** Hi AIUXE, thanks for reviewing the curriculum from the user experience perspective, focusing on interaction, context, feedback, and accessibility within the extension.

**[*] Step 1: Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational content in the specific lessons were working on?**

**AI UX Engineer (Simulated):** The biggest challenge is designing a truly intuitive and non-intrusive learning experience *within* a complex tool engineers use for their daily work (Cursor). The extension UI needs to be clearly educational but not get in the way of the coding environment. Integrating interactive exercises seamlessly, managing state between steps, providing clear feedback, and ensuring it's all fully accessible (especially if using custom Webview components) within the VSCode extension framework requires significant design and testing effort. Making context management (Module 2.2) intuitive – helping users leverage Cursor's features effectively without cognitive overload – is another key challenge.

**[*] Step 2: Do you see any lessons within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of those challenges?**

**AI UX Engineer (Simulated):** Module 1.3 (Conceptual Cursor Interaction) needs to carefully set the stage for the *actual* interaction they'll experience in the extension from Unit 2 onwards. Module 2.2 (Context Engineering) needs dedicated focus on the *UX* of using `@Codebase`, `@Symbol`, etc., perhaps with interactive tutorials demonstrating best practices. All modules delivered via the extension (Units 2-5) need their activities reviewed through the lens of extension usability and accessibility. The feedback mechanisms mentioned in Supporting Elements need specific UI design integrated into the extension workflow for practical lessons.

**[*] Step 3: What limitations should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**AI UX Engineer (Simulated):** We are limited by the VSCode extension API and the chosen UI technology (Notebooks vs. Webviews). Notebooks offer less UI customization, potentially limiting interactivity or feedback presentation. Webviews offer more freedom but increase complexity and the risk of performance issues or a non-native feel. We're also limited in how much we can modify the core Cursor UI; our educational elements have to live within standard extension points (panels, views, commands). We can't fundamentally change how Cursor handles chat or diffs, only build educational layers around them. Accessibility implementation for custom controls in Webviews requires dedicated effort.

**[*] Step 4: What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**AI UX Engineer (Simulated):** The key opportunity is *contextual learning*. We can design exercises that appear directly alongside relevant code examples. We can use VSCode features like CodeLens or Decorations to add inline hints or feedback. If using Webviews, we could create highly interactive simulations or visualizations (e.g., showing how context selection affects an AI response). We could build a dedicated "Course Progress" view within the extension sidebar. For feedback, we could integrate simple "thumbs up/down" or "report issue" buttons directly into the AI output display within the chat or inline suggestions, making it frictionless. Visualizing the AI's context, even simply (e.g., listing files used by `@Codebase`), could significantly improve usability and trust.

**AI Facilitator:** Leveraging the IDE's contextual capabilities while managing the limitations of the extension framework seems critical. Thanks for highlighting the specific UX challenges and opportunities, AIUXE.
