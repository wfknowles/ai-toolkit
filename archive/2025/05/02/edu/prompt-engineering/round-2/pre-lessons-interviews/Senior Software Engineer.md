**AI Facilitator:** Hello SSE. Your analysis brings the crucial perspective of practical application within the SDLC, focusing on context, CoT for debugging, code review, and the capstone.

**[*] Step 1: Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational content in the specific lessons were working on?**

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** The main challenge is ensuring the exercises and examples use realistic codebases and SE problems. Generic examples won't resonate or effectively teach how to apply these techniques to the complex, often messy code we see day-to-day. Teaching critical evaluation (3.4) and secure coding practices (4.4) in the context of AI-generated code is also challenging; it requires learners to be vigilant and apply rigorous standards, which takes practice. Finally, the Capstone project (5.1) needs to be well-defined enough to be achievable but open enough to allow for meaningful application of skills to a non-trivial problem. Finding that balance for potentially 200 engineers is tough.

**[*] Step 2: Do you see any lessons within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of those challenges?**

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** All practical exercise modules (Units 2-4 activities) need review to ensure they use sufficiently realistic code examples and scenarios. Module 2.2 (Context Engineering) must emphasize providing *effective* context from real codebases. Module 3.4 (Evaluation/Code Review) needs dedicated exercises where learners practice reviewing AI code against a checklist or rubric, identifying specific flaws (logic, security, style). Module 4.4 (Security) should include practical examples of security vulnerabilities AI might introduce and how to spot/fix them. Module 5.1 (Capstone) requires clear project templates, realistic starter code (if applicable), and well-defined scope options.

**[*] Step 3: What limitations should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** We're limited by the complexity of the codebases we can reasonably include in exercises within the extension; we likely can't use full production codebases. This might limit the realism of some context engineering (2.2, 3.2) or debugging (3.1) tasks. We are limited in the amount of time available for code review practice (3.4); developing strong review skills takes significant experience. The Capstone (5.1), while valuable, will be limited in scope compared to real-world projects. We also can't guarantee that the prompting techniques taught will always work perfectly on every real-world problem engineers face.

**[*] Step 4: What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** The extension provides a fantastic opportunity for *situated* learning. We can have exercises where learners debug or refactor code within a small, provided project structure directly in Cursor. For code review (3.4), we could build interactive exercises where learners highlight issues in AI-generated code snippets and categorize them. The Capstone (5.1) is a major opportunity for learners to apply skills to a problem relevant to their own work (as PO suggested), potentially creating real value. We could leverage Cursor's diff views extensively to help learners analyze and compare AI suggestions. We could potentially integrate with linters or static analysis tools directly within the extension to provide automated feedback on AI-generated code as part of evaluation exercises (linking to AIR's point).

**AI Facilitator:** Grounding exercises in realistic code and SDLC tasks, even with limitations, is clearly vital. Integrating code review practice and leveraging IDE features for analysis are great points. Thank you, SSE.
