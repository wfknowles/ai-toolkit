**AI Facilitator:** Hello PO. Your analysis rightly focuses on the value proposition, user needs, and ensuring the course delivers tangible benefits, particularly evident in the showcase and overall prioritization.

**[*] Step 1: Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational content in the specific lessons were working on?**

**Product Owner (Simulated):** The core challenge is ensuring every lesson, especially those delivered via the extension, clearly ties back to improving the engineer's actual workflow and productivity (the core value prop, Module 1.1). It's easy to get lost in cool techniques; we need to constantly ask "How does this help an engineer ship better code faster?" Making sure the Capstone (5.1) and Showcase (5.2) truly reflect this value, rather than just being academic exercises, is critical. We also need to ensure the MVP provides a complete, valuable learning arc, even if some advanced topics are deferred. A disjointed experience between the web app and extension would be a major challenge to perceived value.

**[*] Step 2: Do you see any lessons within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of those challenges?**

**Product Owner (Simulated):** Module 1.1 needs strong, data-backed evidence of the value prop. Every practical exercise in Units 2-4 needs a clear statement of the SE task it relates to and the potential benefit (e.g., "Use few-shot prompting to generate unit tests, saving time and improving coverage"). Module 5.1 (Capstone) needs well-defined project options clearly linked to real-world problems or opportunities identified by SSE/other stakeholders. Module 5.2 (Showcase) needs structure and guidance on how learners should present the *impact* of their project. The initial onboarding experience, bridging Unit 1 (Web) and Unit 2 (Extension), is critical and needs careful review to ensure users see the value and aren't frustrated.

**[*] Step 3: What limitations should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**Product Owner (Simulated):** We're limited in our ability to *directly measure* the individual productivity gains from each specific lesson or technique within the course itself. Measuring the true ROI requires post-course evaluation (linking to PM/PR). We are also limited by the features available in Cursor; the value derived is partly dependent on the tool's capabilities. If Cursor changes significantly, parts of the course might lose relevance. Finally, the value is subjective; different engineers might find different techniques more or less valuable depending on their specific role or projects.

**[*] Step 4: What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**Product Owner (Simulated):** The opportunity is to make the value *explicit* throughout. We can include testimonials or mini-case studies (potentially gathered during the pilot) within lessons. The extension could include features that help learners track their *own* perceived efficiency gains or successful applications of techniques. For the capstone, we could encourage projects that directly address a pain point within their own team's workflow, maximizing relevance and buy-in. We could create a 'prompt library' feature where users can share and rate effective prompts for specific tasks, creating ongoing value and community engagement (Module 5.3). Linking course progress or achievements to internal recognition programs could also enhance perceived value.

**AI Facilitator:** Excellent focus on demonstrating and reinforcing the value proposition throughout the course and linking it to real-world impact. Thank you, PO.
