**AI Facilitator:** Welcome, PE. Your analysis covers the core prompting techniques in Units 2, 3, and 4, along with the critical cross-cutting theme of debugging and refinement.

**[*] Step 1: Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational content in the specific lessons were working on?**

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** The main challenge is teaching the *art* as well as the *science* of prompt engineering within the structured format of lessons and exercises. Crafting truly effective prompts, especially few-shot examples (2.1) or complex CoT prompts (3.1), often involves intuition and creative iteration that's hard to capture in a simple exercise. Teaching debugging (2.4) systematically is also tricky, as failures can be nuanced. Ensuring exercises are complex enough to be meaningful but not so difficult they cause excessive frustration within the IDE environment will be a balancing act. Demonstrating advanced techniques like Self-Consistency or Meta-Prompting (4.1) in a practical, non-contrived way within Cursor might also be difficult.

**[*] Step 2: Do you see any lessons within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of those challenges?**

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** Module 2.1 (Few-Shot) needs exercises that emphasize *how to choose and craft good examples*, not just providing them. Module 2.4 (Debugging) needs a very clear, structured methodology and potentially interactive exercises where users diagnose pre-made failing prompts. Module 3.1 (CoT) should focus on practical application for code explanation/debugging rather than abstract reasoning tasks. Module 4.1 (Advanced Toolbox) might need simplification or focus on only one or two techniques (like Self-Consistency) with clear SE applications, rather than trying to cover too many theoretical concepts. We also need to ensure sufficient practice time is built in for the iterative refinement aspect across all relevant modules.

**[*] Step 3: What limitations should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** We are limited by the specific LLM powering Cursor; prompting techniques that work well for one model might be less effective for another. The course should acknowledge this, although focusing on generally applicable principles. We are limited in the complexity of tasks we can assign in timed exercises – real-world prompt engineering can involve extensive trial-and-error. We can't fully replicate the 'a-ha!' moments of discovering a great prompt structure through exercises alone. The effectiveness of few-shot examples (2.1) is highly dependent on the quality and relevance of the examples, which can be hard to standardize in exercises.

**[*] Step 4: What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to these lessons and the guiding philosophies?**

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** The Cursor extension is a huge opportunity for *immediate feedback*. Learners can try a prompt (Cmd+K/L), see the result, analyze it, and refine it in seconds – reinforcing the iterative loop (2.4). We can build exercises that require users to *compare* the outputs of different prompt variations side-by-side. We could include a 'prompt analysis' feature (perhaps using another AI call) that gives feedback on the *structure* or *clarity* of a user's prompt. For debugging (2.4), we could create exercises where users must identify *why* a prompt failed based on the AI's (suboptimal) output. The 'prompt library' idea mentioned by PO is also relevant here – sharing effective prompt patterns discovered by learners (5.3). We could also have 'expert walkthrough' videos (potentially web-based) showing a PE iteratively developing a complex prompt.

**AI Facilitator:** Emphasizing that iterative loop and providing tools/exercises for analysis and comparison within the extension seems key. Focusing advanced techniques on clear SE applications is also a good point. Thank you, PE.
