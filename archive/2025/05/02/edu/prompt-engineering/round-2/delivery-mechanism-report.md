## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the decision-making process and outcome regarding the primary delivery mechanism for the Prompt Engineering Mastery course. Following analysis of SME perspectives and a focused group discussion, the recommended approach is a **Hybrid Model**, combining a core Web Application with a companion VSCode Extension specifically integrated with Cursor. This approach aims to balance the need for broad accessibility and a controlled learning environment with the pedagogical benefits of authentic, integrated practice within the developer's primary tool.

## 2. Problem Definition

The key decision was choosing between delivering the course primarily as:
*   A VSCode Extension (fully integrated into Cursor).
*   A standalone Web Application.
*   A combination (Hybrid) of both.

The choice impacts accessibility, pedagogical effectiveness, user experience, technical feasibility, and development effort.

## 3. Process & Analysis

1.  **SME Pre-Analysis (Simulated):** SMEs individually considered the pros and cons of Extension vs. Web App from their disciplinary perspectives (technical, UX, pedagogy, PM).
2.  **Pre-Planning Synthesis:** Key themes, conflicts, and discussion questions were identified (see `pre-planning-analysis.md`). Dominant themes included workflow integration (pro-extension), accessibility (pro-webapp), pedagogical trade-offs (authenticity vs. cognitive load), and technical feasibility.
3.  **Group Discussion (Simulated):** Facilitated discussion explored these themes and questions (see `delivery-mechanism-interview.md`). Arguments for both pure approaches were weighed.

## 4. Decision: Hybrid Model

The consensus recommendation is to adopt a **Hybrid Model** structured as follows:

*   **Component 1: Core Web Application**
    *   **Purpose:** Host primary course content (theory, concepts, videos, readings for Units 1-4), manage user accounts and progress, deliver non-interactive examples and quizzes, potentially host community forums.
    *   **Rationale:** Maximizes accessibility (browser-based), provides a controlled learning environment optimal for foundational knowledge acquisition, potentially lower cognitive load for initial concepts, simpler UI development for static content.
*   **Component 2: Companion VSCode Extension (Cursor Integration)**
    *   **Purpose:** Deliver highly interactive learning modules, particularly those requiring direct prompt execution, code generation/analysis, debugging workflows, and integration with user codebases within the Cursor IDE. Key focus areas include practical exercises for Units 2 & 3, and the Capstone Project.
    *   **Rationale:** Enables authentic practice in the context of use, leverages Cursor-specific features, reduces context switching for core practical tasks, aligns with Situated Learning principles for skill application.
    *   **Potential Format:** May utilize VSCode Notebooks for combining explanations and executable cells.

## 5. Rationale & Trade-offs

*   **Benefits:** Balances accessibility and reach (Web) with authentic practice (Extension); allows each platform to play to its strengths; potentially mitigates the risk/complexity of a *full* course extension; addresses key concerns from both technical and pedagogical perspectives.
*   **Challenges/Risks:** Requires development and maintenance of two platforms; necessitates a seamless and intuitive user experience for transitioning between web and extension; technical feasibility of robust web-to-extension communication needs validation; potential for user confusion if transitions aren't smooth.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1.  **Define Component Scope:** Detail precisely which learning activities and features belong in the web app versus the extension.
2.  **Technical Validation Spike:** Conduct a technical investigation (led by AOA/SSE) to:
    *   Verify the feasibility of reliable web-to-extension linking (e.g., custom URIs, APIs).
    *   Assess the VSCode API capabilities for the required interactive extension features (e.g., notebook support, accessing Cursor features programmatically).
    *   Estimate the effort for building the core interaction points of the extension.
3.  **UX Design:** Design the user flow for navigating between the web platform and the extension components, ensuring a smooth experience.
4.  **Refine Roadmap:** Update the project roadmap based on the hybrid approach and findings from the technical spike.

## 7. Conclusion

The Hybrid Model represents a balanced and pragmatic approach to delivering the Prompt Engineering Mastery course. While introducing complexity with two platforms, it best addresses the core requirements of accessibility, pedagogical effectiveness for different types of learning activities, and authentic practice within the target developer environment. Proceeding with the defined next steps, particularly technical validation, is crucial.
