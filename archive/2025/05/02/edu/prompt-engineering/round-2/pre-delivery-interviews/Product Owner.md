**Interviewer:** Your analysis focuses on maximizing value through a hybrid approach, balancing target user needs with broader reach and phased delivery.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational course through a VSCode extension, from a product value perspective?

**Product Owner (Simulated):** The main challenge with the extension component is ensuring it delivers *enough* unique value to justify its development cost and the user installing it. If the interactive exercises aren't significantly better or more authentic than what could be simulated on the web, the value proposition weakens. There's also the risk of the extension feeling like a 'feature' rather than a cohesive course, especially if the web component is extensive. Maintaining feature parity or a clear value distinction between the two requires ongoing product attention. Finally, discoverability within the VSCode marketplace and onboarding users specifically onto the extension component are challenges compared to a simple web link.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any modules or units within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of this decision?

**Product Owner (Simulated):** The hybrid decision forces us to clearly define the value proposition of each unit *on each platform*. We need to ask: "Why does this specific learning activity *need* to be in the extension?" or "Is this foundational concept clear enough on the web before we push the user to the IDE?". This might lead to splitting units or designing activities differently – e.g., a concept explained on the web, followed immediately by a "Try this in Cursor" button linking to a specific extension exercise. We need to ensure the curriculum flow logically guides the user between the two platforms where necessary, reinforcing the value of each.

**Interviewer:** What limitations should we consider as it relates to being bound by VSCode? What limitations should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Product Owner (Simulated):** From a product standpoint, being bound by VSCode limits our potential user base primarily to developers using VSCode or compatible IDEs (like Cursor). It also ties our release cycles and potential feature availability to Microsoft's roadmap for the VSCode API. The Cursor dependency is similar but more specific – we gain tight integration but rely on Cursor's continued success, feature set, and API stability. If users switch away from Cursor, the value of that specific integration is lost. We also have less control over the overall platform look-and-feel and user environment compared to a standalone web app.

**Interviewer:** What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to operating within VSCode? What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Product Owner (Simulated):** The VSCode environment offers opportunities for personalization based on the user's context (e.g., tailoring exercises to the programming language they're using). We can integrate directly with source control or other developer tools they might have installed. The biggest opportunity with Cursor is creating a unique selling proposition: "Learn Prompt Engineering *specifically for the Cursor workflow*". This targeted value is powerful. We could offer features like saving useful prompts generated during the course directly into the user's Cursor prompt library, or analyzing their Cursor usage patterns (with permission) to suggest relevant course modules. The hybrid model also allows cross-promotion – using the web app to drive extension installs and vice-versa.

**Interviewer:** That provides a clear product view on the hybrid model. Thanks.
