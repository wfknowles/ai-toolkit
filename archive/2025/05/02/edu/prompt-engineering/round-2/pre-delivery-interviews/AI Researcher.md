**Interviewer:** Your analysis thoughtfully considers how the delivery platform choice impacts research, evaluation, and experimentation, suggesting a hybrid offers flexibility.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational course through a VSCode extension, from a research and evaluation perspective?

**AI Researcher (Simulated):** The main challenges involve data collection and experimental control within the extension. Collecting rich interaction data (keystrokes, prompt iterations, command usage) raises significant privacy and ethical concerns that must be addressed rigorously through anonymization and explicit user consent. Implementing controlled experiments (e.g., A/B testing different feedback mechanisms) within the extension is technically more complex than in a standard web environment. Ensuring the reliability and validity of performance-based assessments conducted within the potentially variable context of the user's IDE also requires careful design and potentially sophisticated analysis techniques.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any modules or units within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of this decision?

**AI Researcher (Simulated):** The decision reinforces the need to define clear *evaluation strategies* for each unit, tailored to the platform. For Unit 1 (Foundations) on the web, traditional quizzes might suffice. For Units 2-4 and the Capstone within the extension, we need to design robust performance-based assessments. How do we objectively measure the quality of a refined prompt (Unit 3) or the effectiveness of an agent (Unit 4) based on user actions within the extension? This might require developing specific metrics, rubrics, or even automated analysis tools built into the extension for evaluation purposes. The curriculum itself is likely fine, but the *assessment* layer needs careful design mapped to the hybrid platforms.

**Interviewer:** What limitations should we consider as it relates to being bound by VSCode? What limitations should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**AI Researcher (Simulated):** VSCode limitations: The extension environment might limit the types of data we can easily collect compared to a fully controlled web platform. Inter-rater reliability could be an issue if assessments rely on subjective evaluation of user actions within the IDE. Cursor limitations: Specific Cursor features might be 'black boxes' that limit our ability to analyze the underlying processes during evaluation. Relying on Cursor also means our evaluation findings might be less generalizable to users of other IDEs or vanilla VSCode.

**Interviewer:** What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to operating within VSCode? What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**AI Researcher (Simulated):** Opportunities: The extension enables ecologically valid assessment â€“ evaluating skills in the actual environment where they are used. We can collect rich, contextual data on learning processes (e.g., how users iterate on prompts, how they debug code generated by AI). This data could fuel genuinely novel research into how developers learn and use AI tools. Within Cursor, we have the opportunity to specifically research the effectiveness of learning *within* an AI-native IDE. We could run experiments comparing learning outcomes for users learning prompt engineering via our extension in Cursor versus a standard VSCode setup, or test the impact of specific Cursor features on the learning curve. The extension could also facilitate peer-review assessments where users evaluate each other's prompts or capstone projects directly within the IDE context.

**Interviewer:** The potential for ecologically valid assessment and research is compelling. Thank you.
