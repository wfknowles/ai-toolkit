**Interviewer:** Thanks for providing your analysis. You strongly advocate for the VSCode extension due to authentic practice and leveraging IDE features. Let's dive a bit deeper.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational course through a VSCode extension?

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** The main challenge isn't *if* we can do it, but doing it *well*. Building a truly seamless and intuitive learning UI within the extension framework is harder than standard web dev. We need to avoid creating something clunky that fights the native IDE feel. Performance is another potential challenge – if the extension bogs down the IDE, users will hate it. Finally, ensuring it works smoothly across different setups and potentially OS versions requires careful testing.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any modules or units within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of this decision?

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** Not necessarily reviewed, but *adapted*. Unit 1 (Foundations) could feel a bit dry if it's just text/diagrams inside an extension panel. We'd need to think creatively about making even the foundational concepts interactive within the IDE context where possible – maybe simple prompts showing tokenization differences, or using the chat feature for Q&A. Units 2, 3, and 4 actually become *more* powerful delivered via the extension, as we can design exercises that directly use the IDE for prompt iteration, debugging, RAG with local files, and agent simulation. The Capstone absolutely benefits. So, it's more about *how* we design the learning activities within each unit to leverage the extension's strengths.

**Interviewer:** What limitations should we consider as it relates to being bound by VSCode? What limitations should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** Within VSCode generally, the main limitations are UI flexibility compared to the open web, potential performance impact, and the inherent complexity of the environment which could be a barrier for absolute beginners (though less so for our target audience). We're also dependent on the VSCode API stability and evolution. Specifically within *Cursor*, the limitations are fewer, it's more about *opportunities*. Cursor already provides the core AI interaction features (chat, diffs, commands) that we want to build upon. The limitation might be if we need functionality that Cursor *doesn't* expose easily to extensions, or if future Cursor updates change APIs we rely on. But mostly, Cursor provides the ideal foundation.

**Interviewer:** What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to operating within VSCode? What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Prompt Engineer (Simulated):** Within VSCode generally, the opportunity is deep integration. We can create exercises that analyze code in the active editor, provide inline feedback, leverage the terminal, use file system access for RAG exercises, and use Notebooks for mixed content/code execution. Specifically within *Cursor*, the big opportunity is leveraging its existing AI features seamlessly. We can design exercises that say "Use Cursor chat to explain this code", "Refine this prompt using Cursor's inline edit", or "Analyze the diff Cursor generated for this prompt". We could potentially even build custom commands within Cursor specifically for the course, or provide tailored feedback based on how the user interacts with Cursor's AI features during an exercise. It allows for truly embedded, contextual learning about using an AI coding assistant.

**Interviewer:** Great insights. Thank you.
