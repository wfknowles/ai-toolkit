**Interviewer:** Your analysis pragmatically favors the hybrid model, focusing on risk, scope, and resources.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational course through a VSCode extension, specifically from a project management perspective?

**Project Manager (Simulated):** The main challenges are estimation and dependency management. Estimating the effort required to build complex interactive features within the VSCode extension framework is harder than for standard web development, making timeline planning riskier. There's a dependency on specific VSCode/Cursor APIs being available and stable. There's also the risk of unforeseen technical roadblocks during extension development that could cause significant delays. Finally, coordinating the development and release cycles of *two* interconnected platforms (web and extension) adds overhead compared to a single platform.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any modules or units within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of this decision?

**Project Manager (Simulated):** From a project perspective, the hybrid decision necessitates a clear mapping of curriculum modules/activities to either the web or extension component. This mapping directly impacts the scope and dependencies for each part. We need to define the MVP for both platforms very clearly based on the curriculum. For instance, which specific interactive exercises in Units 2 and 3 are essential for the *initial* launch of the extension, versus which could be added later? This breakdown is crucial for creating a realistic initial project plan and potential phased rollout.

**Interviewer:** What limitations should we consider as it relates to being bound by VSCode? What limitations should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Project Manager (Simulated):** The key limitation is the dependency risk. Being bound by VSCode means any breaking changes in their API releases could force unplanned work on our end. The reliance on potentially less documented or stable APIs within Cursor specifically adds another layer of risk that needs careful technical validation and potentially mitigation planning (e.g., designing the extension defensively). We also have less control over the overall environment compared to a web app, which can complicate testing and support.

**Interviewer:** What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to operating within VSCode? What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Project Manager (Simulated):** The opportunity lies in delivering a highly targeted, high-value product for developers already using these tools, potentially leading to strong adoption within that group. The hybrid model offers the opportunity for phased releases â€“ launching the web component first to gain initial users and feedback while continuing development on the extension. The deep integration offered by Cursor could also be a key differentiator compared to more generic prompt engineering courses. From a project standpoint, leveraging existing IDE features (like Notebooks) could potentially *reduce* the development effort for certain interactive components compared to building them from scratch in a web app.

**Interviewer:** That clarifies the project implications well. Thank you.
