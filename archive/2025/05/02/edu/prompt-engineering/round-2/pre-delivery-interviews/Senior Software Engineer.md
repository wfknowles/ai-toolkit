**Interviewer:** Your analysis strongly favors the extension for authenticity and efficiency, while accepting a hybrid model. Let's explore that.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any inherent challenges to delivering our educational course through a VSCode extension, even the extension part of a hybrid?

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** Yeah, the main challenge from a developer's perspective is ensuring it's not annoying. If the extension is slow, buggy, or constantly throws errors, it'll actively hinder learning and I'll just disable it. So, quality and performance are paramount. There's also the challenge of making the interactive exercises robust enough to handle different user setups or edge cases without breaking. And as others mentioned, building a good UI/UX inside VSCode isn't as straightforward as web dev.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any modules or units within the curriculum that might need to be reviewed as a result of this decision?

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** I agree with the Prompt Engineer – the content doesn't need review, but the *exercises* do. We need to really lean into the IDE integration for Units 2, 3, and 4. For example, in Unit 3 (Debugging/Refinement), exercises should involve analyzing actual code, using Cursor's diff view to compare prompt outputs, maybe even integrating with debugging tools if possible. The Capstone needs to be a realistic project runnable within the IDE, using the techniques learned. Unit 1 could potentially stay mostly text/concepts, maybe delivered via the web part of the hybrid, to avoid building simple stuff unnecessarily into the extension.

**Interviewer:** What limitations should we consider as it relates to being bound by VSCode? What limitations should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** VSCode limitations: UI constraints, potential performance bottlenecks, dependency on VSCode APIs. We can't build *anything* we want, we have to work within the extension framework. Cursor limitations: Primarily, we're betting on Cursor's platform stability and the continued availability/consistency of its AI features and any extension APIs it provides. If Cursor pivots hard, our extension might need significant rework. Also, we need to be sure we can actually *access* the Cursor features we need programmatically from the extension (like triggering chat, getting diffs, etc.) – needs validation.

**Interviewer:** What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider as it relates to operating within VSCode? What new functionalities or opportunities should we consider using the extension within Cursor IDE?

**Senior Software Engineer (Simulated):** Big opportunities in VSCode: using the file system for realistic RAG exercises, integrating with the built-in terminal for commands or scripts, using the full power of the editor for code analysis/manipulation exercises. Notebooks are a great format. Within Cursor specifically: the *main* opportunity is teaching *how to use Cursor effectively*. Exercises could involve specific Cursor workflows, analyzing Cursor's output quality, comparing different Cursor commands. We could even build linters or analyzers within the extension that give feedback on the *prompts* the user writes in Cursor during exercises. Another opportunity: providing pre-configured project templates or sample codebases bundled with the extension for exercises and the capstone.

**Interviewer:** Very helpful perspective, particularly on the practical exercises. Thanks.
