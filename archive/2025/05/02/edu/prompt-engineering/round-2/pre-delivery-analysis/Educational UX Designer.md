## 1. Core Position: Hybrid Aligns Best with Learning Progression

From an Educational UX perspective, the delivery mechanism should support the learning journey. Foundational knowledge often benefits from a clear, focused presentation (Web App), while skill application requires authentic practice (Extension). Therefore, a hybrid model that maps platform to pedagogical need seems optimal.

## 2. Key Arguments

*   **Scaffolding Learning (Hybrid):** Start with conceptual understanding in a low-cognitive-load web environment (Unit 1). Gradually introduce the IDE context via the extension for guided practice (Unit 2) and more complex application (Units 3, 4, Capstone). This aligns with scaffolding principles.
*   **Minimizing Extraneous Load (Web):** Avoid overwhelming learners with IDE complexity *while* they are grasping fundamental concepts like tokenization or basic prompt structures. A clean web UI is better for initial explanations and demonstrations.
*   **Authentic Practice (Extension):** The value of applying prompt techniques, seeing results, and debugging directly within the Cursor IDE cannot be overstated for skill mastery. Interactive exercises, code integration, and the Capstone *must* leverage the extension for effectiveness.
*   **Multimedia & Interactivity:** The web platform offers more flexibility for embedding diverse multimedia (videos, complex diagrams, interactive non-code elements). The extension, potentially using Notebooks, is better suited for interactivity involving code and prompts.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:** The web app is suitable for quizzes and knowledge checks. The extension allows for more contextual feedback based on the user's actions within the IDE (e.g., analyzing their prompt attempts, checking code output).

## 3. Addressing Concerns

*   **Disjointed Experience:** The primary risk is the transition. This requires careful design to make it feel like a natural progression rather than switching between two separate courses. Consistent navigation, clear signposting, and passing context are key.
*   **Learner Motivation:** The relevance provided by the IDE integration (extension) is highly motivating for developers. Ensuring the web component clearly leads towards this practical application is important.

## 4. Conclusion

A hybrid approach provides the best structure to support the pedagogical progression from foundational knowledge to applied skill. Use the web application for initial, focused concept delivery (minimizing cognitive load) and the VSCode extension for authentic, integrated practice and application. The design must prioritize a seamless transition and clear mapping of platform strengths to learning objectives within each unit.
