## 1. Core Position: Strong Advocacy for VSCode Extension

From a Prompt Engineering perspective, delivering this course as a VSCode extension integrated into Cursor is overwhelmingly superior. The core of prompt engineering is iterative refinement within a development context. A web app inherently creates a barrier and disconnect from this authentic workflow.

## 2. Key Arguments

*   **Authentic Practice:** Learning prompt techniques requires immediate application and feedback *within* the coding environment. Crafting a prompt, sending it to the LLM (via Cursor's features), viewing the diff, refining the prompt â€“ this loop is central. A web app can only simulate this, adding friction and reducing realism.
*   **Leveraging Cursor Features:** Cursor provides built-in tools (chat, diff views, potential custom commands) that are ideal for teaching prompt engineering. An extension can leverage these directly, providing a richer and more integrated learning experience than a web app could replicate. Imagine exercises that ask users to use specific Cursor commands or analyze its diff output.
*   **Reduced Context Switching:** Developers live in their IDE. Forcing them to switch to a separate web application for learning interrupts their flow and makes the learning feel less relevant to their daily work. Keeping the course within the IDE promotes seamless integration of learning and practice.
*   **Direct Code Integration:** Advanced prompt engineering often involves interacting with code (e.g., generating code, explaining code, using RAG with a codebase). An extension allows exercises to directly reference and interact with the user's open project files, something a web app cannot easily do.

## 3. Addressing Concerns

*   **Complexity/Cognitive Load:** While IDEs are complex, the target audience (engineers) is already familiar with them. The extension's UI should be carefully designed to be intuitive, perhaps using familiar patterns like VSCode Notebooks or dedicated views. The benefit of authentic practice outweighs the risk of marginal additional cognitive load for this audience.
*   **Accessibility:** While a web app is more broadly accessible, this course targets developers actively using or learning to use tools like Cursor. The requirement is appropriate for the primary audience. Perhaps introductory conceptual modules could exist on a web platform (hybrid), but the core practical work *must* be in the IDE.

## 4. Conclusion

For teaching the practical skills of prompt engineering effectively to developers, a VSCode extension is the optimal choice. It provides the necessary authentic practice environment, leverages the IDE's capabilities, and integrates learning directly into the developer's workflow. A hybrid approach where practical exercises live in the extension is acceptable, but a web-app-only solution would significantly compromise pedagogical effectiveness for this skill set.
