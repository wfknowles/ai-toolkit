## 1. Core Position: Favor Extension for Practicality, Acknowledge Hybrid Need

As an engineer who would be taking *and* potentially contributing to such a course, the closer the learning is to my actual workflow, the better. Therefore, my strong preference is for delivery via a VSCode extension integrated with Cursor. However, I recognize the technical complexities raised by the Architect and the accessibility points from others, making a well-designed hybrid approach the most likely practical outcome.

## 2. Key Arguments (from a Developer/Learner view)

*   **Authenticity Matters Most:** Learning prompt engineering is about building intuition through practice. Running prompts against real code, debugging errors in the IDE, seeing how prompts interact with linters or other tools – this is invaluable. A web app feels like a detached tutorial; an extension feels like learning on the job.
*   **Integration with Real Tasks:** The capstone project, in particular, needs deep IDE integration. I want to be able to apply prompt techniques directly to a codebase, perhaps even my own work project (if feasible/allowed), facilitated by the extension.
*   **Efficiency:** Not having to switch contexts constantly between a browser window and my IDE saves time and mental energy. I can immediately apply what I'm learning.
*   **Technical Implementation (Extension):** While acknowledging the challenges, the VSCode API *is* powerful. Webviews, Notebooks, Terminal integration, custom commands, accessing the file system and editor state – these provide the building blocks for a rich interactive experience. It requires skilled development but isn't impossible.

## 3. Addressing Concerns

*   **Web App Simplicity:** While a web app might *seem* simpler, replicating the necessary interactivity for meaningful prompt/code exercises would require building a complex pseudo-IDE interface within the browser, which introduces its own set of challenges and likely feels less authentic.
*   **Hybrid Complexity:** The key challenge for a hybrid model is the seamlessness of the integration. If switching between the web and the extension feels clunky or disjointed, it could be frustrating. The API and UX need to be rock solid.

## 4. Conclusion

My ideal learning experience is fully within the Cursor IDE via an extension. This provides the most authentic, efficient, and practical way to master prompt engineering skills. Recognizing the technical and accessibility arguments, a hybrid model is acceptable *if* the extension component provides the core interactive, practical exercises and the integration with the web component is seamless. Priority should be given to maximizing the capabilities and polish of the extension part for Units 2, 3, 4, and the Capstone.
