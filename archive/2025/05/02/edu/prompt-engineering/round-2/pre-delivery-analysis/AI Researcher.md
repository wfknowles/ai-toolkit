## 1. Core Position: Platform Choice Impacts Evaluation and Experimentation

From a research perspective, the delivery platform influences how we can teach foundational concepts, evaluate learning effectiveness, and potentially conduct novel educational experiments. Both web and extension platforms offer different opportunities and constraints in these areas. A hybrid approach might offer the most flexibility for diverse research and evaluation goals.

## 2. Key Arguments

*   **Teaching Foundational Concepts:** Explaining abstract LLM concepts (tokenization, attention, etc.) might be easier with the richer multimedia and layout control of a web application. However, linking these concepts directly to observable behaviors within the IDE (extension) can enhance understanding (e.g., showing token counts for a prompt in the IDE).
*   **Evaluation Methods:** 
    *   **Web App:** Better suited for traditional assessments like quizzes, multiple-choice questions, and potentially analyzing written responses to conceptual questions.
    *   **Extension:** Enables performance-based assessment within an authentic context. We could measure task completion times, analyze the quality of generated prompts/code, track usage of specific techniques, or even collect fine-grained interaction data (keystrokes, command usage) for deeper analysis of learning processes (with appropriate ethics/privacy considerations).
*   **Experimentation Potential:** 
    *   **Web App:** Easier to run A/B tests on content presentation, explanations, or simple interactive elements.
    *   **Extension:** Allows for experiments involving different IDE-based feedback mechanisms, variations in exercise design within the authentic context, or comparing learning outcomes with/without specific IDE integrations.
*   **Data Collection:** Both platforms allow for collecting usage data. The extension potentially offers richer, more contextual data about the user's interaction with code and prompts during learning tasks.

## 3. Addressing Concerns

*   **Data Privacy/Ethics:** Collecting detailed interaction data, especially within the IDE extension, requires careful consideration of privacy, consent, and data anonymization.
*   **Technical Complexity:** Implementing sophisticated evaluation or experimentation features within either platform, especially the extension, adds technical complexity.

## 4. Conclusion

No single platform is universally superior for all research and evaluation goals. A web app excels at delivering and assessing foundational knowledge traditionally. An extension excels at performance-based assessment and experimentation within an authentic context. A hybrid approach offers the most flexibility, allowing researchers to choose the most appropriate platform for specific evaluation questions or experimental designs across different course units. The choice should consider the specific learning objectives being evaluated and the type of data required.
