# Pre-Lesson Analysis: AI Agent Engineer

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Unit 4: Advanced Techniques (Modules 4.2, 4.3)

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **Module 4.2 (Agentic Concepts):** Find simplified, practical examples of Observe-Think-Act or ReAct loops that can be demonstrated *using only prompts* within Cursor's chat/edit features, applied to SE tasks like iterative debugging or planning code implementation. Visualizations needed?
*   **Module 4.3 (Tool Use):** Research common patterns for describing tools (APIs, functions) within LLM prompts for effective use. How to best represent tool parameters and expected output formats in the prompt? Examples of prompting for robust error handling when a simulated tool fails or returns unexpected output. How are tools like linters or build systems typically integrated into AI coding assistant workflows?
*   **Frameworks (Conceptual):** Briefly research how concepts from frameworks like LangGraph (state machines) or crewAI (collaboration) could be *conceptually* introduced or simulated through prompting strategies within Cursor, without needing the actual frameworks.
