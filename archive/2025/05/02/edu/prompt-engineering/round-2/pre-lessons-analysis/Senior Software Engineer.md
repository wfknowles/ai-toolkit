# Pre-Lesson Analysis: Senior Software Engineer

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft (Module 2.2 - context from SE perspective)
*   Unit 3: Building Complexity (Modules 3.1, 3.4)
*   Unit 4: Advanced Techniques (Module 4.4 - security evaluation)
*   Unit 5: Capstone Application (Module 5.1)
*   Cross-Cutting: Critical Evaluation, Cursor Integration, AI Code Review Best Practices

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **Module 3.1 (CoT):** Find case studies or examples where CoT prompting significantly improved AI assistance for *complex debugging* scenarios encountered by senior engineers (e.g., race conditions, memory leaks).
*   **Module 3.4 (Code Review):** Gather established best practices, checklists, or frameworks specifically for reviewing code generated by AI tools like Cursor/Copilot. How do common code review criteria need adaptation? Examples of subtle bugs AI tends to introduce.
*   **Module 5.1 (Capstone):** Research realistic, challenging problems solvable within an IDE extension context that would make good capstone projects for demonstrating prompt engineering mastery. Examples: advanced refactoring tools, code analysis/visualization aids, automated documentation based on code structure/tests. What scaffolding/support is needed?
*   **Cross-Cutting (Integration):** Find examples of how prompt engineering is integrated into *team workflows* (e.g., using shared prompt libraries, incorporating AI review steps into PR processes). How are teams measuring the *real-world impact* of AI coding assistance on velocity/quality?
