# Pre-Lesson Analysis: Project Manager

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Overall Curriculum Structure & Flow
*   Unit 5: Capstone & Continuous Learning (Modules 5.2, 5.3 - integration, community)
*   Cross-Cutting Themes (linking to overall goals)
*   Supporting Elements (Infrastructure, Metrics)

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **Overall:** Research best practices for structuring blended learning technical courses (Web + IDE extension). How to ensure smooth transitions and consistent experience? Examples of effective onboarding for IDE-based learning tools.
*   **Module 5.2 (Showcase):** Find examples of effective formats for virtual project showcases and peer feedback sessions suitable for ~200 engineers potentially across different time zones. Tools/platforms?
*   **Module 5.3 (Community):** Research strategies and platforms for fostering a successful internal Community of Practice around prompt engineering/AI tools. How to encourage contribution and knowledge sharing?
*   **Metrics:** Based on the Kirkpatrick/LTEM model chosen, research specific, *measurable* Level 3 (Behavior) and Level 4 (Results) metrics for evaluating the impact of this *specific* prompt engineering training within a software engineering organization. How to realistically collect this data? Examples of ROI calculation for similar technical training.
