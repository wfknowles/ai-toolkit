# Pre-Lesson Analysis: Educational UX Designer

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Unit 1: Foundations (Web App Delivery)
*   Unit 2-4: Interaction design within Extension
*   Cross-Cutting: Visualizations, Cognitive Load Management
*   Supporting Elements: Interactive Platform Design (Web & Extension)

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **Hybrid Design:** Find case studies or best practices for designing cohesive learning experiences across a hybrid Web + IDE Extension model. How to link content, maintain progress tracking, and ensure consistent terminology/UI?
*   **Web App (Unit 1):** Research engaging interactive elements suitable for web-based delivery of foundational AI concepts (e.g., interactive diagrams, simple simulators, drag-and-drop exercises). Examples of applying Multimedia Learning Principles effectively in web tutorials for technical topics.
*   **Extension Design (Units 2-5):** How to best apply Mayer's Multimedia Principles (Coherence, Signaling, etc.) within the constraints of a VSCode Notebook or Webview? Examples of effective visualizations for concepts like CoT reasoning or RAG flows *within an IDE panel*. Strategies for scaffolding interactive exercises in the extension to manage cognitive load.
*   **Visualizations:** Compile a library of high-quality, accessible visualizations explaining core LLM/prompting concepts (tokenization, attention, few-shot, CoT, RAG, agent loops) suitable for engineers.
