# Pre-Lesson Analysis: AI Researcher

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Unit 1: Foundations (Modules 1.1, 1.4)
*   Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft (Module 2.2 - Tokenization)
*   Unit 3: Building Complexity (Modules 3.2, 3.4 - RAG/Evaluation)
*   Unit 4: Advanced Techniques (Modules 4.1, 4.4 - Advanced concepts/Eval/Security)
*   Cross-Cutting: Ethical Considerations, Critical Evaluation

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **Module 1.4 / Ethics:** Gather recent examples and discussion points regarding ethical challenges specific to *AI code generation* (e.g., bias in generated code, ownership/licensing issues, potential for generating insecure code). How to integrate these discussions effectively into practical lessons?
*   **Module 2.2 (Tokenization):** Find research comparing the impact of different tokenization strategies (e.g., BPE vs SentencePiece) specifically on *code generation tasks* across different programming languages. Any tools for visualizing tokenization specifically for code?
*   **Module 3.2 (RAG):** Research the latest advancements in RAG techniques beyond basic retrieval (e.g., iterative retrieval, query transformation, re-ranking). How can these more advanced concepts be explained simply? Metrics for evaluating the *quality of retrieved context* in RAG systems (Context Precision/Recall).
*   **Module 3.4 / 4.4 (Evaluation):** Compile a list of robust metrics and methodologies for evaluating the quality, correctness, and safety of AI-generated *code* (beyond standard text metrics like BLEU/ROUGE). Examples: functional correctness (Pass@k), code complexity metrics, security vulnerability scanning results. Frameworks like Ragas/DeepEval applicability to code output?
*   **Module 4.1 (Advanced):** Find clear explanations and potential simple applications (demonstrable via prompting) of techniques like Self-Consistency or Reflexion in the context of improving code generation or reasoning about code.
