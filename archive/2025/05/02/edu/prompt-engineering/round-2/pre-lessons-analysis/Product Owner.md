# Pre-Lesson Analysis: Product Owner

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Unit 1: Foundations (Module 1.1 - Value Prop)
*   Unit 5: Capstone & Continuous Learning (Module 5.2 - Showcase Value)
*   Cross-Cutting Themes (Alignment with Engineer Needs)
*   Supporting Elements (Linking Features to Value)

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **Module 1.1 (Value):** Gather recent quantitative data or strong case studies demonstrating the productivity/quality gains engineers achieve using tools like Cursor/Copilot effectively (beyond marketing claims). What specific SE tasks see the biggest benefit?
*   **User Needs:** Research common pain points or frustrations engineers have when *first* using AI coding assistants. How can the early lessons (Units 1-2) directly address these?
*   **Module 5.2 (Showcase):** What makes a compelling demo/showcase for technical projects like the capstone? How to best articulate the *business value* or *workflow improvement* achieved, not just the technical implementation?
*   **Prioritization:** Research methods for prioritizing features/content in technical training based on learner needs and potential impact. How to gather feedback effectively during pilot/rollout to inform future iterations (linking to PM)?
