# Pre-Lesson Analysis: AI UX Engineer

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Unit 1: Foundations (Module 1.3 - Conceptual Interaction -> Real Interaction)
*   Unit 2: Core Prompt Craft (Module 2.2 - Context UX)
*   Cross-Cutting: Cursor Integration, Accessibility
*   Supporting Elements: Interactive Platform (Extension), Feedback Mechanisms

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **IDE Interaction:** Research best practices and innovative UI patterns for embedding interactive tutorials and exercises *within* VSCode extensions. Examples beyond simple text/code display (e.g., guided interactions, visualizations within webviews/notebooks). How to handle state between exercise steps seamlessly?
*   **Context UX:** Explore UI patterns for making the AI's current context more transparent to the user within Cursor (e.g., visualizing files being used by `@Codebase`). How to provide intuitive controls for managing context scope within the extension?
*   **Feedback UX:** Find examples of effective, low-friction UI for collecting user feedback on AI suggestions/outputs *directly within the IDE*. How can this feedback be visually acknowledged or used to guide refinement within the extension?
*   **Accessibility:** Research specific WCAG AA guidelines and testing methodologies for *VSCode Notebooks* vs. *Webviews* within extensions. Tools for automated accessibility testing of extensions?
