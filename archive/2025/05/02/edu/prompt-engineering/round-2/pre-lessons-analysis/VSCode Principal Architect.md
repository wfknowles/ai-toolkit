# Pre-Lesson Analysis: VSCode Principal Architect

**Focus Areas (Curriculum v2):**
*   Overall Hybrid Architecture
*   Supporting Elements: Web-Extension API design, Security, Scalability

**Research Notes for RAs:**
*   **Hybrid Architecture Patterns:** Research common architectural patterns for hybrid Web + Desktop/Extension applications, focusing on secure communication, data synchronization, and maintaining user sessions across platforms. Examples in the educational tech space?
*   **API Design:** Compile best practices for designing secure, scalable, and maintainable APIs specifically for communication between a web backend and a VSCode extension. Authentication/authorization strategies? Versioning approaches?
*   **Extension Security:** Research the security model of VSCode extensions. What are the primary risks associated with extensions (especially those communicating externally or manipulating code)? Best practices for sandboxing or limiting extension capabilities from an architectural perspective? How does running within Cursor potentially alter the security landscape?
*   **Scalability:** Considerations for scaling the web backend and the API to support ~200 concurrent users interacting with potentially stateful extension exercises. Caching strategies? Database considerations?
