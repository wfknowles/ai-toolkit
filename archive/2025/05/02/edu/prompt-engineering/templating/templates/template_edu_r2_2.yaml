  description: |
    Review the agreed upon Curriculum ({{input_context.items[0].path}}), the R2 Pre-Analysis 
    ({{input_context.items[1].path}}), and R2 Pre-Interviews ({{input_context.items[2].path}}). Also consider the R1 brainstorming outputs ({{input_context.items[3].path}}).
    The goal is to work with SMEs to create detailed outlines for pre-researching 
    material needed for Round 3's creation of final deliverables (requirements/roadmaps). 
    You will be guiding research assistants through this pre-research phase via these outlines.

  # Add other phases from original R2.2 if they were intended, e.g., Facilitator Planning? Asset Creation?
  # The original R2.2 prompt seemed incomplete/confusing in later phases.
  # Adding a simple confirmation phase here based on refactored structure.

    steps: |
        *   **Step 1 (Facilitator):** **Context Check:** Before executing the steps in this phase, briefly state which major information blocks or files from the previous phase (Phase 2 - Outline Generation) are no longer strictly required for completing Phase 3 and explain why. If all previous context remains necessary, state that.
            *(Output context check summary to chat)*

        *   **Step 2 (Facilitator):** Confirm that all planned steps and outputs for this prompt have been successfully completed.
            *(Output confirmation to chat: "Phase 3, Step 2: All planned steps completed. 9 SME research outlines generated in {{pre_outlines_dir}}.")*
