    Review the Round 1 outputs ({{input_context.items[0].path}}, {{input_context.items[1].path}}) 
    and the agreed Curriculum Outline ({{input_context.items[2].path}}). 
    The goal of this prompt (Round 2, Part 1) is to prepare for Round 3 (Creation of Final Deliverables: Requirements/Roadmaps/Edu Material) 
    by working with SMEs to define lesson ideas/abstracts and then interview them regarding specific research/planning questions 
    derived from those ideas and the overall curriculum. You will manage the process through distinct phases, ensuring all outputs are saved correctly.
