    Review the previous brainstorming discussion ({{input_context.items[0].path}}) 
    and the initial SME concepts ({{input_context.items[1].path}}). 
    The goal is to synthesize these ideas and define a high-level outline 
    (major sections/units) for an educational course on mastering prompt engineering.
