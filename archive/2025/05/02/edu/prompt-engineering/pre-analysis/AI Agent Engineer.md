# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI Agent Engineer (AAE)

**Review of Previous Session:** The discussion correctly identified that full autonomous agent building is likely out of scope for the main course, but the *concepts* are crucial for understanding advanced workflows and Cursor's potential. The capstone idea of a simple agentic helper makes sense.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on Agentic Capabilities & Concepts):**

*   **Module 1-2: (As per PE/SSE/Prof Ed - Foundations & Core Techniques)** - Necessary groundwork.
*   **Module 3: Introduction to Agentic Thinking**
    *   The Observe-Think-Act Loop (Conceptual)
    *   Planning & Decomposition via Prompting (Link to CoT & Prompt Chaining)
    *   State Management Basics (How prompts carry state/memory implicitly)
    *   *Activity:* Analyze a simple multi-step task and design a prompt chain for it.
*   **Module 4: Enabling Agent Actions: Tool Use & Memory**
    *   Prompting for Tool Selection & Execution (Theory & Simple Examples)
    *   Handling Tool Output/Errors in Prompts
    *   Memory Concepts: Short-term (Context Window) vs. Long-term (RAG/Vector DB Intro)
    *   Prompting Strategies for Basic RAG
    *   *Activity:* Write prompts to instruct a simulated tool (linter); Write prompts incorporating retrieved text snippets.
*   **Module 5: Building Simple Agentic Workflows**
    *   Designing Multi-step Workflows with Basic Tool Use
    *   Error Handling & Recovery Prompts for Workflows
    *   Debugging Agentic Chains (Tracing prompt flows)
    *   *Activity:* Design/Implement the Capstone Project (e.g., automated doc generator, multi-step refactoring assistant).
*   **Module 6: Advanced Concepts & Future Directions (Optional/Advanced Track)**
    *   Overview of Advanced Agent Architectures (ReAct, Reflexion)
    *   Multi-Agent Concepts (Briefly)
    *   Dynamic Prompt Generation Concepts
    *   Safety & Alignment Considerations for Agents

**Concerns/Feedback:** Need to keep the tool use examples very practical and ideally executable within the Cursor/playground environment. Avoid getting bogged down in complex agent framework implementations. Focus on how *prompting* enables these agentic behaviors. The distinction between prompt chaining and true agent loops needs to be clear.
