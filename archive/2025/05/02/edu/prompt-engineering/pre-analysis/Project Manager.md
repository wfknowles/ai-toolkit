# Project Manager - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Project Manager (PM)

**Review of Previous Session:** The 20 concepts cover the critical aspects needed for a successful training initiative, including rollout, metrics, and maintenance. The phased approach (Concept #18) is essential for managing risk and incorporating feedback.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on Course Delivery & Management):**

*   **Phase 0: Course Planning & Setup**
    *   Define Scope (MVP vs. Full Course) & Success Metrics (Concept #19)
    *   Resource Allocation & Budgeting (Concept #7)
    *   Platform Selection/Setup (Liaise with Ed UX)
    *   Timeline & Milestone Definition (Concept #5)
    *   Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan (Concept #6)
    *   Stakeholder Identification & Communication Plan (Concept #4)
*   **Phase 1: MVP Content Development & Pilot**
    *   Develop Core Modules (Concepts #1, #2, #3, #4)
    *   Pilot Group Selection & Scheduling
    *   Execute Pilot Program
    *   Gather Pilot Feedback (Surveys, Interviews - Concept #18)
*   **Phase 2: Iteration & Full Rollout**
    *   Analyze Pilot Feedback & Iterate on MVP Content/Platform
    *   Develop Advanced Modules (Concepts #5-#13)
    *   Finalize Full Course Curriculum
    *   Develop Internal Marketing & Communication Materials (Concept #9)
    *   Execute Phased Rollout to Full Audience (Concept #1)
    *   Change Management Activities (Concept #8)
*   **Phase 3: Ongoing Management & Maintenance**
    *   Monitor Success Metrics & Report on Value (Concept #19)
    *   Implement Content Maintenance Plan (Concept #20)
    *   Facilitate Community of Practice (Concept #17)
    *   Plan for Future Updates/Versions
    *   Budget for Ongoing Operations

**Concerns/Feedback:** Need clear ownership for content maintenance (Concept #20) â€“ this is crucial for long-term relevance. Managing the schedules of 200 engineers for training requires careful planning and communication. Defining *measurable* success metrics beyond just completion rates will be key to demonstrating ROI (Concept #19).
