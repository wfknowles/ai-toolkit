# AI Researcher - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI Researcher (AIR)

**Review of Previous Session:** The discussion highlighted a good balance between practical application (Cursor focus) and foundational understanding. The emphasis on scaffolding (Prof Ed) and situated learning (PR) makes sense for introducing complex topics like tokenization or CoT effectively. The 20 concepts form a solid base.

**Outline Structure Proposal:**

*   **Module 1: Foundations - What & Why?**
    *   Intro to LLMs (Transformers high-level, Capabilities/Limitations)
    *   Prompting Fundamentals (Role, Task, Context, Format)
    *   Cursor Introduction & Basic Interaction
    *   Ethical Considerations & Responsible AI Use (Bias, Hallucination intro)
*   **Module 2: Core Techniques - The How**
    *   Zero-shot vs Few-shot (with SE examples)
    *   Context Engineering I (Basic code context, Cursor features)
    *   Output Formatting I (Basic controls, Markdown/JSON)
    *   Iterative Refinement & Basic Debugging
    *   *Theory Link:* Tokenization Basics (linked to context/output issues)
*   **Module 3: Intermediate Reasoning & Workflows**
    *   Chain-of-Thought (Zero/Few-shot for code debug/explanation)
    *   Context Engineering II (Handling larger context, intro to RAG concept)
    *   Prompt Chaining I (Simple multi-step SE tasks in Cursor)
    *   Evaluating Outputs I (Heuristics, basic code review of AI output)
    *   *Theory Link:* Context Windows & Attention (linked to context eng.)
*   **Module 4: Advanced Prompting & Agentic Concepts**
    *   Advanced Prompting Techniques (Self-Consistency, ToT concepts, Meta-prompting examples)
    *   Prompt Chaining II & Basic Orchestration Ideas
    *   Agentic Concepts (Loops, Tool Use theory, Memory types)
    *   Prompting for Tool Use (Simple examples like linters)
    *   Evaluating Outputs II (Metrics intro, Security/Robustness checks)
    *   *Theory Link:* Agent Architectures (ReAct/Reflexion overview)
*   **Module 5: Mastery & Application**
    *   Capstone Project (e.g., Simple agentic helper for SE task)
    *   Advanced Debugging & Evaluation Case Studies
    *   Future Trends & Continuous Learning
    *   Community of Practice Kick-off

**Concerns/Feedback:** Need to ensure theoretical links are tightly integrated and don't feel like separate lectures. The depth of "Agentic Concepts" needs careful scoping for this audience. Evaluation methods need to be practical for engineers.
