# Educational UX Engineer - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Educational UX Engineer (Ed UX)

**Review of Previous Session:** The emphasis on an interactive platform, playground, and visualizations is great. Integrating realistic SE context (SSE) and robust feedback loops (Prof Ed, PR) is crucial for usability and learning effectiveness.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on Learning Experience & Platform Features):**

*   **Module 0: Platform Onboarding & Setup**
    *   Navigating the Learning Platform UI
    *   Setting up/Accessing Cursor (if needed)
    *   Introduction to the Prompt Playground/Simulator
    *   Accessibility Features Overview
*   **Module 1: Engaging with AI in Cursor**
    *   *UX Focus:* Understanding the Cursor chat interface, context features (@-mentions), interpreting diffs.
    *   Content: Basic prompts, simple code gen/explanation.
    *   *Platform Feature:* Guided interactive tutorials within a simulated Cursor environment.
*   **Module 2: Building Your Prompting Toolkit**
    *   *UX Focus:* Designing prompts for clarity, using the playground effectively, understanding feedback.
    *   Content: Zero/Few-shot, Context Eng I, Output Formatting I, Iterative Refinement.
    *   *Platform Feature:* Prompt playground with syntax highlighting, token count estimation, direct comparison of different prompt outputs.
*   **Module 3: Tackling Complexity**
    *   *UX Focus:* Visualizing CoT, managing larger contexts in prompts, understanding workflow steps.
    *   Content: CoT, Context Eng II (RAG concept), Prompt Chaining I, Evaluating Outputs I.
    *   *Platform Feature:* Interactive diagrams for CoT/Chaining; Ability to load larger code context examples into playground; Peer review interface for prompt evaluation.
*   **Module 4: Advanced Techniques & Exploration**
    *   *UX Focus:* Making advanced concepts (agents, tool use) understandable, providing clear examples.
    *   Content: Adv. Techniques Overview, Prompting for Tool Use.
    *   *Platform Feature:* Sandboxed environment for simple tool use simulation (e.g., calling a mock linter); curated library of advanced prompt examples.
*   **Module 5: Capstone & Community**
    *   *UX Focus:* Supporting project development (individual/group), facilitating showcase/feedback.
    *   Content: Capstone Project, Continuous Learning resources.
    *   *Platform Feature:* Project submission area; Gallery for showcasing projects; Forum/integration for Community of Practice.

**Concerns/Feedback:** The biggest challenge is creating a seamless and intuitive playground/simulation that accurately reflects Cursor's behavior and supports diverse exercises. Ensuring the platform provides truly helpful, non-generic feedback on prompt exercises is key. Accessibility must be designed in from the start.
