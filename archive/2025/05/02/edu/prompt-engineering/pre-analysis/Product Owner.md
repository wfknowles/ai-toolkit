# Product Owner - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Product Owner (PO)

**Review of Previous Session:** Strong alignment on the core value proposition: empowering engineers with practical AI skills via Cursor to boost productivity and quality. The MVP approach is smart. Defining "mastery" and ensuring relevance to daily SE workflows were key discussion points.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on Value Delivery & Course Evolution):**

*   **Module Group: The "Why" & The "What" (Core Value - MVP)**
    *   Module 1: The AI Advantage for Engineers (Value Prop, Intro AI/LLM/Prompting)
    *   Module 2: Getting Started with Cursor (Basic Interaction, Key Features)
    *   Module 3: Essential Prompting Patterns for SE Tasks (Core techniques: context, iteration, basic code gen/debug examples in Cursor)
    *   *Value Focus:* Deliver immediate, demonstrable productivity wins.
*   **Module Group: Enhancing Capabilities (Intermediate Value)**
    *   Module 4: Reasoning with AI (CoT for Debugging/Analysis)
    *   Module 5: Working with More Context (Context Eng, Intro RAG)
    *   Module 6: Building Simple Workflows (Prompt Chaining for common SE sequences)
    *   Module 7: Ensuring Quality (Evaluating AI Outputs, Refining Prompts)
    *   *Value Focus:* Enable engineers to tackle more complex problems and improve output quality.
*   **Module Group: Towards Mastery (Advanced/Future Value)**
    *   Module 8: Advanced Prompting Techniques & Concepts (Self-Consistency, Meta-Prompting, Agentic Ideas)
    *   Module 9: Leveraging Tools & External Knowledge (Prompting for Tool Use, RAG patterns)
    *   Module 10: Capstone: Applying Mastery to a Real Problem
    *   *Value Focus:* Unlock potential for significant automation, innovation, and solving novel challenges.
*   **Supporting Elements (Continuous Value)**
    *   Onboarding & Platform Experience (Ed UX Lead)
    *   Community & Continuous Learning Resources (PR Lead)
    *   Course Maintenance & Roadmap (PM Lead)

**Concerns/Feedback:** Need to constantly tie modules back to the core value proposition for engineers and the business. Prioritization of advanced topics post-MVP needs to be driven by feedback and observed needs. Defining the capstone project scope realistically is important for perceived value. How do we best collect and showcase success stories (Concept #11)?
