# AI UX Engineer - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI UX Engineer (AI UX)

**Review of Previous Session:** Good focus on the practicalities of using AI within the Cursor workflow. Key UX challenges like context management, trust, error handling, and cognitive load were identified. The platform ideas from Ed UX align well.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on Human-AI Interaction & Usability in Cursor):**

*   **Module 1: Introduction - AI as a Collaborator**
    *   Understanding AI Capabilities & Limitations (Setting expectations)
    *   Human-AI Collaboration Patterns (Assistant vs. Collaborator)
    *   UX of Cursor: Chat, Context Features, Diff Views
    *   *Activity:* Critique good/bad examples of AI interaction in a chat interface.
*   **Module 2: Crafting Usable Prompts**
    *   Clarity & Specificity for Predictable Outputs
    *   Providing Context Effectively (User Burden vs. AI Need)
    *   Iterative Refinement from a UX Perspective (Reducing friction)
    *   Handling Ambiguity: Prompts for Clarification
    *   *Activity:* Refine vague prompts to be more effective; Practice providing context in Cursor.
*   **Module 3: Building Trust & Understanding**
    *   Transparency through Prompting (CoT for explanations)
    *   Prompting to Identify/Mitigate AI Bias (Awareness)
    *   Understanding & Handling Hallucinations/Errors Gracefully
    *   Evaluating AI Output Quality (Heuristics for SE tasks)
    *   *Activity:* Analyze AI outputs for potential bias or errors; Use CoT to understand AI reasoning.
*   **Module 4: Designing Efficient Workflows**
    *   Prompt Chaining for Reduced Manual Effort
    *   Context Management Strategies (Impact on UX)
    *   Personalization Opportunities (Tailoring prompts to user style/tasks)
    *   Managing Cognitive Load with Complex Prompts
    *   *Activity:* Design a prompt chain for a common SE workflow; Discuss strategies for managing long/complex prompts.
*   **Module 5: Advanced Interaction & Ethics**
    *   UX Considerations for Simple Agentic Helpers
    *   Prompting for Tool Use (User control & confirmation)
    *   Ethical UX: User Autonomy, Privacy in AI Assistance
    *   Providing Feedback on AI Performance (Closing the loop)
    *   *Activity:* Design the interaction flow for a simple agentic task; Discuss ethical scenarios.

**Concerns/Feedback:** Need to ensure the course constantly reinforces the link between prompt design and the *engineer's experience* using the AI. Avoid getting too technical without bringing it back to usability, trust, and efficiency for the end-user engineer. The ethical considerations should be woven throughout, not just a final module.
