# Prompt Engineer - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Prompt Engineer (PE)

**Review of Previous Session:** The overall direction aligns well with core prompt engineering principles. Good emphasis on iterative refinement, context engineering, and introducing advanced techniques like CoT and chaining progressively.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on the Craft of Prompting):**

*   **Module 1: Prompting Essentials**
    *   Anatomy of Effective Prompts (Role, Instruction, Context, Examples, Output Spec)
    *   Clarity, Specificity, and Avoiding Ambiguity
    *   Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot: When and How (Crafting Good Examples)
    *   Basic Cursor Interaction & Prompting Interface
    *   *Exercise:* Writing & refining basic code explanation/generation prompts.
*   **Module 2: Context is King**
    *   Why Context Matters (Grounding, Relevance)
    *   Strategies for Providing Code Context (Snippets, Files, @-mentions)
    *   Understanding Context Windows & Tokenization Impact
    *   Basic RAG Concepts & Prompting with Retrieved Info
    *   *Exercise:* Experimenting with different context provision methods for a coding task.
*   **Module 3: Enhancing Reasoning & Output**
    *   Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Debugging & Logic
    *   Controlling Output: Formatting (JSON, MD), Style, Constraints
    *   Iterative Refinement Workflow: Test, Analyze, Debug, Improve
    *   Basic Prompt Debugging Techniques
    *   *Exercise:* Using CoT to debug code; Prompting for specific output formats.
*   **Module 4: Building Workflows**
    *   Prompt Chaining: Decomposing Tasks & Passing State
    *   Meta-Prompting: Generating Prompts Dynamically
    *   Introduction to Agentic Concepts (Prompting for Planning & Tool Use)
    *   *Exercise:* Design and test a simple prompt chain for a multi-step SE task.
*   **Module 5: Advanced Techniques & Evaluation**
    *   Self-Consistency for Robustness
    *   Advanced Prompt Debugging Case Studies
    *   Evaluating Prompt & Output Quality (Metrics & Heuristics)
    *   Security Considerations (Prompt Injection Basics)
    *   Prompt Templates & Sharing Best Practices
    *   *Exercise:* Apply Self-Consistency; Evaluate different prompts for a complex task.
*   **Capstone:** Comprehensive project applying multiple techniques.

**Concerns/Feedback:** Ensure sufficient hands-on practice for *each* technique. The debugging module (#3 & #5) is critical. Need to provide clear frameworks/checklists for evaluating prompts and outputs. Balancing the number of techniques covered with depth of practice is key.
