# Professor of Education - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Professor of Education (Prof Ed)

**Review of Previous Session:** Excellent synthesis of ideas. The 20 concepts capture key pedagogical needs like scaffolding, authentic assessment, and collaborative learning. The focus on an MVP and iterative rollout (PM, PO) aligns with good instructional design principles.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on Learning Progression):**

*   **Unit 1: Orientation & Basic Interaction (Remembering & Understanding)**
    *   Module 1.1: Why AI & Prompting for Us? (Value Prop, Ethics Basics)
    *   Module 1.2: Meet Cursor: Your AI Pair Programmer
    *   Module 1.3: Anatomy of a Prompt (Instructions, Context, Output)
    *   *Activity:* Simple code explanation/generation prompts in Cursor.
    *   *Assessment:* Quiz on basic terms & concepts.
*   **Unit 2: Applying Core Prompting Techniques (Applying)**
    *   Module 2.1: Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot in Practice (Cursor Examples)
    *   Module 2.2: Providing Effective Code Context
    *   Module 2.3: Getting the Output You Need (Formatting basics)
    *   Module 2.4: The Refinement Loop: Debugging Your Prompts
    *   *Activity:* Series of scaffolded exercises applying techniques to SE tasks (docs, tests, simple refactors) in Cursor playground.
    *   *Assessment:* Practical exercise applying core techniques; Peer review of prompts.
*   **Unit 3: Deeper Reasoning & Workflows (Analyzing & Evaluating)**
    *   Module 3.1: Thinking Step-by-Step: Chain-of-Thought for Debugging/Analysis
    *   Module 3.2: Handling More Context: Intro to RAG Ideas & Advanced Context Eng.
    *   Module 3.3: Linking Prompts: Basic Workflow Automation
    *   Module 3.4: Critiquing AI: Evaluating Code Quality & Correctness
    *   *Activity:* Analyze complex code using CoT; Design a simple prompt chain; Evaluate AI-generated code snippets.
    *   *Assessment:* Short analysis tasks; Design a simple workflow prompt.
*   **Unit 4: Towards Mastery: Advanced Concepts & Creation (Creating)**
    *   Module 4.1: Overview of Advanced Techniques (Self-Consistency, Meta-Prompting, Agent Concepts)
    *   Module 4.2: Introduction to Prompting for Tool Use
    *   Module 4.3: Project Workshop: Defining Your Capstone
    *   *Activity:* Experiment with advanced techniques in playground; Brainstorm project ideas.
*   **Unit 5: Capstone Project & Continuous Learning (Creating & Synthesis)**
    *   Module 5.1: Capstone Project Development (Individual or Pairs)
    *   Module 5.2: Project Showcase & Peer Feedback
    *   Module 5.3: Joining the Community: Lifelong Learning
    *   *Assessment:* Capstone project completion and presentation/demonstration.

**Concerns/Feedback:** Ensure assessments are truly authentic to SE work. Provide ample opportunities for practice and feedback (formative assessment). Clearly signpost learning objectives for each module using Bloom's levels. The capstone needs good definition and support.
