# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** AI Orchestrator/Architect (AOA)

**Review of Previous Session:** The discussion correctly identified the need to focus on practical *workflows* rather than deep agent theory for this audience. Concepts like prompt chaining, RAG, and meta-prompting are the right level of abstraction for improving SE tasks.

**Outline Structure Proposal (Focus on Workflow Design & System Patterns):**

*   **Fundamentals (Modules 1-2):** Cover LLM basics, core prompting, Cursor intro (as per consensus).
*   **Module 3: Designing Prompt Chains**
    *   Concept of decomposing tasks into sequential prompts.
    *   Passing context/state between prompts.
    *   Error handling within chains (simple retry/fallback prompts).
    *   *Use Case:* Multi-step code generation or refactoring.
*   **Module 4: Leveraging External Knowledge (RAG Patterns)**
    *   The "Why" of RAG: Grounding & Knowledge Augmentation.
    *   Prompting patterns for incorporating retrieved context (from docs, code search).
    *   Context Management for RAG (Summarization/Distillation ideas).
    *   *Use Case:* Answering questions about a codebase using retrieved documentation.
*   **Module 5: Dynamic & Adaptive Prompting (Meta-Prompting)**
    *   Concept: Prompts that generate/modify other prompts.
    *   Use cases: Generating complex configurations, adapting prompts based on user input, creating task-specific templates.
    *   *Use Case:* Prompt that takes requirements and generates a detailed code-gen prompt.
*   **Module 6: Introduction to Agentic Workflow Concepts**
    *   Agent loops (conceptual), Planning via prompts (linking to CoT/Chaining).
    *   Prompting for basic Tool Use (selecting & calling simulated tools).
    *   Memory concepts (short-term context vs. long-term retrieval via RAG).
    *   *Use Case:* Design a workflow for a simple agentic helper (e.g., code reviewer that lints, summarizes changes, suggests improvements).
*   **Module 7: Architecture Considerations (Higher Level)**
    *   Evaluating different workflow patterns (tradeoffs).
    *   Performance & Cost considerations for complex chains.
    *   Security & Robustness in chained prompts/tool use.
    *   Scalability thoughts (briefly).
*   **Capstone:** Design and potentially prototype a multi-step prompt-driven workflow for a complex SE task.

**Concerns/Feedback:** Keep the architecture discussion high-level and focused on patterns applicable *within* or orchestrated *from* the engineer's environment (Cursor). Avoid deep dives into deployment infrastructure unless directly relevant to prompt design choices (e.g., latency). Ensure clear distinction between simple prompt chains and more complex agent loops.
