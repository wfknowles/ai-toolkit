# Pedagogy Researcher - Initial Outline Thoughts

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Persona:** Pedagogy Researcher (PR)

**Review of Previous Session:** The previous discussion successfully integrated key learning science principles. The structure proposed by Prof Ed (Units based on Bloom's taxonomy) provides a strong pedagogical foundation. My focus is ensuring the *how* of learning within that structure.

**Outline Structure Augmentation (Adding Learning Science Layers):**

*(Building on Prof Ed's Unit Structure)*

*   **Unit 1: Orientation (Understand)**
    *   *Pedagogy Focus:* Activate prior knowledge (SE experience), establish relevance (Andragogy), manage initial cognitive load. Address misconceptions (Conceptual Change).
    *   *Activities:* Diagnostic quiz (optional), relatable SE scenarios solved by AI, clear goal setting (SRL).
*   **Unit 2: Core Application (Apply)**
    *   *Pedagogy Focus:* Situated Learning (practice in Cursor context), Scaffolding (start simple, add complexity), Dual Coding (visuals + text for techniques), immediate formative feedback.
    *   *Activities:* Hands-on exercises in playground, prompt debugging tasks framed as problem-solving (Error Analysis).
*   **Unit 3: Analysis & Evaluation (Analyze, Evaluate)**
    *   *Pedagogy Focus:* Promote higher-order thinking, skills transfer to novel problems, metacognition (reflecting on prompt effectiveness).
    *   *Activities:* Comparative analysis (different prompts for same task), critiquing AI outputs, designing workflows, self-assessment prompts (SRL).
*   **Unit 4: Creation & Advanced Concepts (Create)**
    *   *Pedagogy Focus:* Support creative application, problem-based learning (PBL via capstone ideation), introduce complexity gradually (Cognitive Load).
    *   *Activities:* Brainstorming sessions, exploring advanced technique examples, project proposal development.
*   **Unit 5: Synthesis & Transfer (Create, Synthesis)**
    *   *Pedagogy Focus:* Reinforce learning through application (PBL), foster Community of Practice, plan for Spaced Repetition/Interleaving post-course.
    *   *Activities:* Capstone project development, peer feedback sessions, creating reusable prompt resources, contributing to internal prompt library.

**Concerns/Feedback:** Measuring actual learning *transfer* (Concept #8) back to the job is difficult but crucial - need to design for this (e.g., pre/post self-efficacy surveys, optional follow-up analysis of work artifacts with consent). Ensuring feedback mechanisms support learning, not just grading, is vital. Cognitive load in advanced modules needs careful management.
