# CISO - Pre-Analysis Concepts (Refined)

*Initial concepts focusing on information security strategy, risk, compliance, and governance for the configurable AI counseling tool, considering the dual user roles and sensitive financial data.*

1.  **Dual Data Governance Policy:** Establish data governance policies that explicitly address both client (dad) financial data and expert (father) configuration data. Define ownership, access rights, retention, and disposal for each data type.
2.  **Compliance for Counseling Aspects:** Assess compliance requirements related not just to financial data (GDPR/CCPA) but also potentially to providing advice (even automated), depending on jurisdiction and specificity. Ensure the expert configuration doesn't inadvertently push the tool into regulated advice territory.
3.  **Third-Party Risk (Expert Tools):** Extend third-party risk management to include any tools or platforms used specifically for the expert portal or configuration management, in addition to Plaid/AI APIs used by the client app.
4.  **Access Control Policy (Client vs. Expert):** Define and enforce a strict access control policy based on roles (client, expert, admin). Pay special attention to permissions granted to the expert role regarding client data visibility and configuration capabilities.
5.  **Incident Response Plan (Dual Focus):** Ensure the IR plan covers scenarios involving compromises of either the client application OR the expert portal, including unauthorized access to client data or malicious configuration changes.
6.  **Privacy Policy Transparency (Configurability):** Ensure the client (dad) privacy policy clearly explains that their experience is guided by parameters set by their designated expert (father) and how their data is summarized for expert review.
7.  **Ethical AI Framework (Configurable):** Establish ethical guidelines for how AI is used, ensuring that expert configurations cannot lead to discriminatory, unfair, or harmful AI behavior towards the client. Include checks for bias introduced via configuration.
8.  **Audit Trails for Configuration:** Implement comprehensive audit trails logging who changed which client configurations, what was changed, and when. This is crucial for accountability and incident investigation.
9.  **Training for Experts on Secure Configuration:** Provide guidance or training to experts (father) on using the configuration portal securely and responsibly, emphasizing the privacy implications of the parameters they set.

# CISO - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial brainstorming concepts based on the provided guidance, focusing on overall information security strategy, risk management, compliance, data governance, and incident response for the AI-driven budgeting application.*

1.  **Data Governance Framework:** Establish a clear data governance policy defining data ownership, classification (e.g., PII, Sensitive Financial Data), handling procedures, retention schedules, and access controls for the financial data collected.
2.  **Compliance Requirements Assessment:** Analyze applicable compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, potentially financial regulations depending on specific features like investment advice - although not requested here) and ensure the architecture and processes are designed to meet them.
3.  **Third-Party Risk Management (Plaid, AI Services):** Implement a robust process for assessing and managing the security risks associated with third-party vendors, particularly Plaid (data aggregator) and any external AI service providers. Review their security postures and contracts.
4.  **Security Awareness Training (Internal):** Ensure developers and anyone handling user data receive appropriate security awareness training, focusing on secure coding practices, social engineering, and data privacy responsibilities.
5.  **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a comprehensive incident response plan detailing steps to take in case of a security breach, data leak, or major service outage. Include roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, and forensic procedures.
6.  **Privacy Policy & Terms of Service Review:** Ensure the application's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service accurately reflect data collection, usage, and security practices, are transparent to the user, and comply with legal requirements.
7.  **Security Metrics and Reporting:** Define key security metrics (e.g., vulnerabilities patched, security incidents, compliance status) to track the effectiveness of the security program and report regularly to stakeholders.
8.  **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery:** Ensure plans are in place for business continuity and disaster recovery, including regular data backups (PostgreSQL), failover mechanisms, and procedures for restoring service after an outage.
9.  **Ethical AI Considerations & Bias Mitigation:** Review the use of AI for potential ethical concerns or biases (e.g., AI insights unfairly disadvantaging certain user groups). Ensure transparency and fairness in how AI makes suggestions or analyzes data. Advocate for user control over their data and AI interactions.
