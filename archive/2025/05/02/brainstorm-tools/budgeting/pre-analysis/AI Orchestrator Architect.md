# AI Orchestrator Architect - Pre-Analysis Concepts (Refined)

*Initial concepts focusing on system architecture to support personalized, configurable counseling using the $2618 bi-weekly scenario.*

1.  **Client Configuration Service:** Architect a dedicated service/module responsible for storing and managing the expert's (father's) configuration settings per client (dad). This includes preferred counseling style (prompt tone/focus), priority goals, target savings rates, custom budget rules, etc.
2.  **Income Processing & Baseline Calculation Flow:** Design an orchestrated flow that takes the $2618 bi-weekly income, calculates the monthly average (~$5670), identifies and subtracts known fixed expenses (mortgage, child support, orthodontics â€“ possibly via user input or transaction analysis), establishing a baseline disposable income figure for budgeting logic.
3.  **Configurable Budgeting Engine Service:** Architect a service that takes the baseline income, client configuration (from Concept 1), and transaction history, then applies the expert-defined rules or AI analysis (using specified parameters) to generate the initial budget allocation and ongoing suggestions.
4.  **Orchestrated Insight Generation:** Design the orchestrator logic to trigger insight generation by passing relevant data (income, budget, transactions, goals, *expert configuration*) to an AI insight module. Ensure insights align with the expert's defined strategy for the client.
5.  **Agent Coordination with Configuration Context:** If using agents (e.g., Goal Monitor), ensure the orchestrator passes the relevant client configuration context to them. An agent monitoring savings for the dad should know the *expert-defined* priority and target for that specific goal.
6.  **Data Flow for Expert Review:** Architect the data flows necessary to aggregate client progress data (budget adherence, goal progress, key AI interactions) and present it securely to the expert (father) via a separate interface or report generated by the orchestrator.
7.  **Parameter Injection for AI Models:** Design the system so that expert-defined parameters (e.g., risk tolerance level, preferred savings allocation percentages) can be dynamically injected into prompts or used as inputs for AI models generating advice or insights for the client.
8.  **State Management for Counseling Context:** Ensure client state includes not just financial data but also the *active expert configuration* and recent counseling interaction summaries, so AI responses remain consistent with the ongoing strategy.
9.  **Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture (Implied):** Design the overall architecture assuming multiple clients will eventually use the system, ensuring strict data isolation between clients and secure access controls for both clients (dad) and experts (father).
