# Project Manager - Pre-Analysis Concepts (Refined)

*Initial concepts focusing on project management aspects for the configurable counseling tool, considering the $2618 scenario and dual user types (client/expert).*

1.  **Dual-Interface Project Plan:** Structure the project plan to explicitly account for the development of two primary interfaces: the client-facing application (for the dad) and the expert-facing configuration/monitoring portal (for the father).
2.  **MVP Milestone: Expert Configuration Ready:** Define a key early milestone as the completion and testing of the expert configuration portal, as this is necessary before clients can receive configured guidance.
3.  **Risk: Configuration Complexity:** Identify the risk that the expert configuration options become overly complex to manage or implement. Mitigation: Start with a limited, high-impact set of configuration parameters for MVP.
4.  **Risk: Balancing Client vs. Expert Needs:** Acknowledge the risk of development effort being pulled disproportionately towards one user type. Mitigation: Ensure backlog grooming and sprint planning explicitly allocate capacity for both client and expert features.
5.  **Resource Planning for Configurable AI:** Estimate resources needed for developing not just the AI logic, but also the systems to *parameterize* that logic based on expert input and test the varied outputs.
6.  **Timeline Dependency:** Recognize the dependency that client-facing AI features (budgeting, insights) depend on the completion of the expert configuration input mechanism and the core income/expense analysis using the $2618 scenario data.
7.  **Stakeholder Communication Plan:** Define communication plan including regular updates/demos for the primary stakeholder (representing the expert/father's perspective) and potentially gathering feedback from representative end-users (clients like the dad).
8.  **Agile Adaptation for Configuration:** Adapt agile ceremonies (e.g., sprint reviews) to demonstrate how the AI behavior *changes* based on different expert configurations applied to the same base scenario ($2618 income, dad's profile).
9.  **Pilot Testing Plan:** Plan for a pilot testing phase involving the expert (father) configuring the tool for a small number of test clients (simulating the dad's scenario) to validate the configuration workflow and the resulting AI counseling.
