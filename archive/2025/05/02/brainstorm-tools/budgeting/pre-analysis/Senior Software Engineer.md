# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis Concepts (Refined)

*Initial concepts focusing on implementation details for the configurable counseling tool using the $2618 scenario and NestJS/React/PostgreSQL stack.*

1.  **`ClientConfiguration` Module (NestJS):** Implement a dedicated NestJS module with entities (TypeORM/Prisma) and services to manage expert-defined configurations per client (e.g., `ClientConfig` entity linked to `User` entity, storing JSON/structured data for goals, rules, style prefs).
2.  **`IncomeAnalysis` Service (NestJS):** Create a service to handle the $2618 bi-weekly input, calculate monthly estimates, process user input for fixed costs (mortgage, child support, orthodontics), and potentially identify recurring transactions via Plaid data to estimate fixed costs.
3.  **`BudgetingLogic` Service (NestJS):** Implement the core budgeting service. It should accept income data, fixed costs, transaction history, and crucially, the `ClientConfig` object. Logic should apply configured rules (e.g., target percentages) or AI model calls (passing config params) to generate budget outputs.
4.  **Expert Configuration UI (React):** Develop a separate, secure React interface for the expert (father) to manage client configurations. This UI would interact with the `ClientConfiguration` module's API endpoints.
5.  **Parameterization in AI Calls:** Implement the AI interaction layer (NestJS service) to dynamically include parameters from the `ClientConfig` when making calls to external AI APIs or internal models. Ensure these parameters influence prompt structure or model behavior as intended.
6.  **Database Schema for Config & Goals:** Design PostgreSQL tables to store `ClientConfiguration` alongside `User`, `Account`, `Transaction` data. Ensure goals table (`FinancialGoal`) can link to a client config to represent expert-defined priorities.
7.  **Data Aggregation for Expert View:** Implement efficient database queries (PostgreSQL) and potentially caching (Redis) to aggregate relevant client data (spending vs budget, goal progress, recent interactions) for the expert review dashboard/report API endpoint.
8.  **Testing Configurable Logic:** Develop specific unit and integration tests (Jest) to verify that the `BudgetingLogic` service and AI interactions correctly utilize and respond to different `ClientConfig` settings. Test edge cases based on the $2618 income and expense scenario.
9.  **Secure API Endpoints for Expert:** Ensure API endpoints related to viewing client data or modifying configurations (intended for the expert) have distinct and robust authorization checks, separate from client-facing endpoints.

# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis Concepts

*Initial brainstorming concepts based on the provided guidance, focusing on implementation details, technology stack (Node.js/TypeScript/NestJS, React, PostgreSQL), code quality, and feasibility.*

1.  **NestJS Backend Structure:** Define clear modules in NestJS for core functionalities: `Auth`, `Users`, `Accounts` (linked via Plaid/manual), `Transactions`, `Budgets`, `Goals`, `AIInsights`. Utilize DTOs for data validation.
2.  **React Frontend Components:** Develop reusable React components for displaying financial data (charts, tables), budget progress bars, goal tracking, transaction lists with categorization options, and conversational AI interfaces.
3.  **PostgreSQL Schema Design:** Design a robust relational database schema in PostgreSQL to store user data, accounts, transactions (with categories, tags), budgets (by category, period), goals (target amount, deadline), and potentially cached AI insights. Ensure proper indexing for performance.
4.  **Plaid Integration Service:** Implement a dedicated NestJS service to handle Plaid API interactions (Link token exchange, fetching accounts, retrieving transactions) securely, storing necessary credentials/tokens safely.
5.  **AI Model Interaction Layer:** Create an abstraction layer (e.g., a NestJS service) to communicate with the chosen AI models (whether local or cloud-based APIs). This decouples the core application logic from specific AI implementations.
6.  **Background Job Processing:** Utilize a library like `Bull` (for Redis) or integrate with NestJS microservices for handling asynchronous tasks like fetching transactions periodically, running complex AI analyses, or sending notifications without blocking the main API.
7.  **Testing Strategy:** Implement a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests (Jest) for services and controllers, integration tests for API endpoints, and potentially end-to-end tests (Cypress/Playwright) for key user flows.
8.  **API Design (REST/GraphQL):** Define clear and consistent API endpoints (likely REST with NestJS) for the React frontend to consume. Consider GraphQL if frontend data fetching needs become complex.
9.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) for automated testing, building Docker images, and deploying the NestJS backend and React frontend.
