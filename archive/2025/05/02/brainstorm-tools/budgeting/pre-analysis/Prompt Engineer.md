# Prompt Engineer - Pre-Analysis Concepts (Refined)

*Initial concepts focusing on prompts that leverage the $2618 bi-weekly income, family scenario, and expert configuration for personalized budgeting counseling.*

1.  **Configurable Goal Elicitation Prompts:** Design prompt templates where the expert (father) can define the *style* and *initial focus* (e.g., debt reduction first, emergency fund focus) for the AI's goal-setting conversation with the client (dad). The AI then uses this configuration and the $2618 income to guide the dad: "Based on your $5670 monthly income and [Expert's Focus Area], let's explore setting a goal for [Specific Goal]. How much do you think is achievable per month?"
2.  **Income-Based Budget Allocation Prompts:** Create prompts that take the $2618 bi-weekly input, subtract known/estimated fixed costs (mortgage, child support, orthodontics), and propose variable budget allocations based on *expert-defined percentage targets* or *AI-observed habits*. Example: "After your main bills, you have approx. $X left per month. [Expert Name] suggests aiming for Y% on groceries. Your recent average is Z%. How can we align this?"
3.  **Expense Justification Query Prompts:** Prompts for the AI to gently query the user about spending that deviates significantly from the *expert-configured budget plan* or *AI-identified savings goals*, using the specific income context. "I noticed spending in [Category] was higher than planned this month, impacting the [Goal Name] savings derived from your $2618 paychecks. Can we explore why?"
4.  **Configurable "Counseling Moment" Prompts:** Develop prompt templates for recurring check-ins, where the AI's tone and focus are set by the expert. E.g., Configurable for empathetic check-in vs. direct progress review: "Checking in on the budget we set up based on your $5670 monthly income. How are things feeling this week?" or "Let's review progress towards the [Goal Name] goal. We allocated $X per paycheck ($2618). Are we on track?"
5.  **Scenario Simulation Prompts (Personalized):** Prompts allowing the dad to ask "what-if" questions grounded in his reality. "If I get a $100 raise per paycheck (new total $2718 bi-weekly), how should I adjust the budget [Expert Name] helped set up? Where should the extra funds go based on his priorities for me?"
6.  **Child-Related Expense Planning Prompts:** Specific prompts designed to address future needs of the 12/14 yr olds (cars, insurance), using the base income. "Planning for [Child's Name]'s future car insurance might require saving $Y per month. Based on your current $5670 income and budget, let's find ways to allocate that."
7.  **Expert Configuration Interface Prompts (Internal):** Prompts designed for the *expert* (father) to configure the AI's behavior for a specific client â€“ setting target savings rates, defining priority goals, choosing communication style preferences.
8.  **Insight Prompts Based on Habits vs. Plan:** Prompts that highlight discrepancies between the user's spending habits (derived from transactions) and the *expert-configured budget plan* based on the $2618 income. "Your coffee shop spending averages $Z/month, which wasn't explicitly in the initial plan based on the $5670 income. Should we adjust a category or aim to reduce this?"
9.  **Progress Summary Prompts (Expert-View):** Prompts designed to generate summaries *for the expert* showing the client's progress, adherence to the configured plan, areas of difficulty, and AI interaction highlights, enabling the expert to provide targeted follow-up.
