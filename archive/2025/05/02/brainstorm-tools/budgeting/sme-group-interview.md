**Round 1: Initial Analysis - Strengths & Weaknesses (Refined Concepts)**

*   **PO:** Major Strength: This configurability directly addresses the core goal – making it *your father's* insights scaled. Weakness: Defining the right level of configuration for MVP is critical. We must deliver value to both dad and father quickly.
*   **SSE:** Strength: The concepts for dedicated Config services/modules (Arch, SSE) provide a clear technical path. Using the $2618/$5670 figures directly in service logic makes testing specific. Weakness: Querying and applying config dynamically adds complexity to many core services (budgeting, insights).
*   **UX:** Strength: Designing for trust by linking AI actions back to the known expert ([Expert Name] suggested...) is powerful. Weakness: The expert UI needs to be simple enough for non-techy experts (like potentially the father) to use effectively.
*   **Arch:** Strength: The architecture concepts explicitly handle config injection and dual data flows (client/expert). Weakness: Ensuring low latency when fetching/applying config before generating AI responses.
*   **PE:** Strength: Prompts become highly targeted, using both financial data ($2618) and expert strategy. Weakness: Prompts need to handle potential conflicts gracefully – what if dad wants X but father configured Y?
*   **AgentEng:** Strength: Agents acting based on expert rules (Budget Adherence, Goal Monitor) are more predictable and align with the counseling goal. Weakness: Less room for purely emergent AI behavior; agents are primarily executors of the expert's strategy.
*   **SecEng:** Strength: Concepts address securing the config mechanism itself and controlling expert access to client data. Weakness: Increased attack surface with the expert portal; risk of misconfiguration having security implications.
*   **CISO:** Strength: Dual data governance and access policies are crucial and covered. Weakness: Ensuring compliance if the configured "counseling" strays too close to regulated financial advice.
*   **PM:** Strength: Clearer dependencies now – expert config portal is a prerequisite. Weakness: Risk of underestimating effort for the config plumbing and the dual interface testing.

**Round 2: Challenges, Difficulties, Unknowns (Refined Focus)**

*   **SSE:** Challenge: Efficiently joining client data with configuration data for real-time processing. Unknown: Performance impact of complex, configuration-driven queries.
*   **Arch:** Challenge: Designing the `ClientConfiguration` data model to be flexible enough for future expansion but structured enough for reliable use. Unknown: How to best manage updates to configuration – do they apply instantly? How are agents notified of changes?
*   **PO:** Challenge: Defining the MVP set of *configurable parameters*. What gives the expert the most leverage initially? Unknown: How will experts (father) *actually* use the configuration? What support will they need?
*   **UX:** Challenge: How to present the "expert configuration" aspect to the client (dad) without making the AI feel impersonal or predetermined? Balancing transparency and user agency. Unknown: Best way to visualize progress *against* an expert-defined plan.
*   **PE:** Challenge: Writing prompts flexible enough to incorporate *variable* expert configurations (different tones, goals) while remaining coherent and effective. Unknown: Can LLMs reliably maintain a specific expert-defined persona/tone over long interactions?
*   **AgentEng:** Challenge: How do agents signal back to the expert when their configured rules lead to repeated issues or client friction? Unknown: Complexity of testing agent behavior under numerous possible configuration permutations.
*   **SecEng:** Challenge: Securely auditing configuration changes – who changed what, when, and what was the *impact* on AI behavior? Unknown: Scalability of RBAC for potentially many experts and clients.
*   **CISO:** Challenge: Defining clear lines on what constitutes permissible configuration vs. potentially harmful or non-compliant advice structures. Unknown: How to automate monitoring for risky configurations.
*   **PM:** Challenge: Accurately estimating testing effort needed for all configuration variations against the core $2618 scenario. Unknown: Adoption curve for experts – how quickly will they learn/trust the config tools?

**Round 3: Potential Solutions & Strategies (Refined Focus)**

*   **SSE:** Solution (Joins): Denormalize key config flags into client data tables if needed for performance, use caching heavily. Solution (Testing): Create reusable test suites that inject different `ClientConfig` objects for the same $2618 scenario.
*   **Arch:** Solution (Config Model): Start with a core set of typed fields, use JSONB for flexible "advanced" parameters. Solution (Updates): Use event sourcing or pub/sub for config updates to notify relevant services/agents.
*   **PO:** Solution (MVP Config): Focus on core parameters: 1-2 priority goals, target savings rate (% of $5670), maybe 2-3 AI tone options. Get feedback from father early. Solution (Expert Support): Develop clear documentation and maybe short video tutorials for the expert portal.
*   **UX:** Solution (Agency): Frame AI suggestions as "Based on [Expert]'s plan for you, one option is... What do you think?". Give dad override capability (potentially flagged for expert review). Solution (Visualization): Use comparison views: spending vs. *expert-configured* budget line.
*   **PE:** Solution (Flexibility): Use template prompts with slots for config values (tone descriptors, goal names, target numbers). Employ few-shot prompting with examples of desired tone. Solution (Persona): Regular persona reinforcement within meta-prompts.
*   **AgentEng:** Solution (Feedback): Agents can log persistent friction points (e.g., user overrides rule X consistently) for inclusion in the expert summary report. Solution (Testing): Prioritize testing core config variations first, use randomized testing for broader coverage later.
*   **SecEng:** Solution (Auditing): Implement detailed logging at the API/service layer for all config changes, store logs securely. Solution (RBAC): Use standard libraries/frameworks for RBAC, ensure clear separation of roles.
*   **CISO:** Solution (Compliance): Define "guardrails" – disallow configuration parameters that enable specific financial product recommendations. Implement keyword monitoring in config inputs. Solution (Monitoring): Develop specific alerts for unusual or potentially risky configuration patterns.
*   **PM:** Solution (Testing Estimate): Allocate specific story points/time for config-permutation testing. Solution (Adoption): Run dedicated pilot/feedback sessions with the father during development.

**Round 4: Selecting Top Concepts (Target: ~10, refined for Configurable Counseling)**

*(Facilitator guides selection focusing on the core configurable counseling loop using the $2618 scenario.)*

**Selected/Refined Concepts (Top 10):**

1.  **Core MVP: Expert Config Portal + Client Budget View:** Expert can set basic rules (% targets for $5670 post-fixed costs, 1 priority goal). Client sees budget reflecting this config.
2.  **`ClientConfiguration` Service & DB Schema:** Backend infrastructure to store and serve expert configs per client.
3.  **Income/Fixed Cost Processor:** Service using $2618 bi-weekly input to establish the baseline for configured budgeting.
4.  **Parameterized Budgeting Engine:** Core logic applying expert rules/targets to baseline income.
5.  **Expert-Linked Goal Setting (Client):** Client sets goals, but suggestions/priorities reflect expert config.
6.  **Configurable AI Tone/Style (Simple):** MVP allows expert to choose 1 of 2-3 predefined AI interaction styles (e.g., 'Coach', 'Assistant').
7.  **Expert Progress Summary Dashboard:** Secure view for expert showing client adherence to *their* configured plan/goals (using dad scenario data).
8.  **Explainability Referencing Expert:** AI suggestions explicitly mention "Based on [Expert]'s plan..." or similar.
9.  **Secure Authentication (Client & Expert):** MFA for expert, robust auth for both.
10. **Basic Configurable Agent (Budget Monitor):** Agent checks spending vs. *expert-defined* budget rules and triggers simple notifications (style per config).

**Round 5: Refining Top Concepts (Configurable Counseling Focus)**

*(Discussion focuses on the interplay between expert configuration and client experience for the $2618 scenario.)*

*   **MVP Config Portal:** Needs fields for: Target Savings Rate (%), Priority Goal #1 (dropdown/text?), AI Tone Choice. Needs client list view.
*   **Config Service:** Define initial schema for `ClientConfiguration`. How are defaults handled if expert sets nothing?
*   **Income Processor:** Needs reliable way to identify/input fixed costs (mortgage, child support, ortho) for the dad.
*   **Budgeting Engine:** Logic must clearly prioritize expert rules over generic suggestions.
*   **Goal Setting:** How does the UI guide the dad towards the expert's priority goal without railroading?
*   **AI Tone:** Define the prompt fragments associated with 'Coach' vs. 'Assistant' tones.
*   **Expert Dashboard:** What specific metrics on dad's $5670 budget are most useful for the father? Spending variance by category? Goal progress %? Interaction frequency?
*   **Explainability:** Standardize phrasing: "Following [Expert]'s focus on [Goal], have you considered...?"
*   **Auth:** Implement using standard libraries (e.g., Passport.js in NestJS).
*   **Budget Agent:** Rules need to be clear: If Spending > Configured Budget * Tolerance%, trigger Notification (using Configured Tone).

**(Session concludes with a clearer picture of the MVP for the configurable counseling tool, ready for report synthesis.)**
