## 1. Introduction & Refined Problem Statement

This report addresses the challenge of providing ongoing, personalized financial guidance that scales the expertise of a human counselor. The specific use case centers on supporting individuals like a divorced father with two teenage children (12 & 14), navigating expenses such as a mortgage, child support, and orthodontics on a fixed bi-weekly take-home pay of **$2618** (approximately $5670 monthly). The goal is to develop an AI-driven tool that acts as a digital extension of a trusted financial expert (e.g., the user's father, an accountant), providing tailored budgeting assistance, goal tracking, and educational nudges between in-person counseling sessions.

Crucially, the tool must be **configurable by the expert**. The expert needs the ability to instill their specific financial philosophy, set client-specific goals and priorities, and even influence the AI's communication style for each client. The AI's primary function is not just to analyze data, but to interpret it and interact with the client *through the lens of the expert's configuration*, leveraging the client's specific financial reality ($2618 income, known expenses) to provide relevant, actionable support.

This document synthesizes the findings of a simulated multi-disciplinary brainstorming session focused on this refined problem statement.

## 2. Methodology (Refined Focus)

The brainstorming methodology was adapted to center on the core requirements:

1.  **Persona Definition:** Utilized the same multi-disciplinary team (PE, Arch, SSE, PO, PM, UX, AgentEng, SecEng, CISO).
2.  **Refined Concept Generation:** Each persona generated new concepts specifically addressing how their expertise could contribute to the *configurable counseling tool*, directly incorporating the **$2618 bi-weekly/$5670 monthly income scenario**, the **divorced dad context** (mortgage, child support, ortho, kids' future needs), and the **expert configuration requirement**. (Documented in `pre-analysis/` directory).
3.  **Focused Facilitator Pre-Planning:** The facilitator analyzed the *refined* concepts, identifying themes centered on configurability, dual-user experiences (client/expert), and leveraging the specific scenario data.
4.  **Refined Simulated Group Brainstorming:** A multi-round discussion was simulated, explicitly discussing the challenges and solutions related to implementing and managing the expert configuration, ensuring AI behavior aligns with expert intent, and addressing the dad's specific financial situation. (Simulated transcript intended for `sme-group-interview.md`.)
5.  **Synthesized Reporting:** This report documents the outcomes, focusing on the concepts selected for the configurable counseling MVP.

## 3. Overview of Considered Concepts (Refined Themes)

The refined pre-analysis yielded concepts heavily focused on the core requirements:

*   **Expert Configuration as Core:** How to architect, implement, secure, and expose the mechanism for experts to define client-specific rules, goals, and AI interaction parameters.
*   **Scenario-Driven Logic:** Directly using the $2618 bi-weekly/$5670 monthly income, known fixed costs (mortgage, child support, orthodontics), and implied variable costs (groceries, kids' needs) as inputs for budgeting, goal setting, and insight generation.
*   **Dual User Interfaces & Experience:** Designing distinct but connected interfaces for the client (dad) receiving guidance and the expert (father) providing configuration and oversight.
*   **AI Behavior Parameterization:** Shifting from generic AI to AI whose actions, suggestions, and communication style are dynamically controlled by the expert's configuration.
*   **Explainability Linked to Expert:** AI communication designed to explicitly reference the expert's plan or configuration as the basis for its suggestions, enhancing trust and reinforcing the counseling relationship.
*   **Security for Configuration & Dual Roles:** Protecting the configuration data and expert portal, implementing RBAC between expert and client roles, and ensuring data minimization in expert views.
*   **Agent Actions as Rule Executors:** AI agents primarily acting based on rules and priorities defined within the expert configuration.

## 4. Concept Selection Rationale (Refined "Top 10")

The simulated discussion prioritized concepts that directly enable the core configurable counseling loop for the target scenario, focusing on an MVP that validates this unique value proposition:

*   **Enabling the Expert:** Prioritizing the backend services and a basic UI for the expert (father) to input configurations is paramount (Concept 1, 2).
*   **Connecting Config to Client:** Ensuring the client's (dad's) budget and initial goals directly reflect the expert's configuration and the specific $2618/$5670 income reality (Concept 1, 3, 4, 5).
*   **Clear Communication & Trust:** Making the AI's link to the expert explicit in its communication and ensuring the interaction style is configurable (Concept 6, 8).
*   **Essential Oversight:** Providing the expert with a basic dashboard to monitor client progress against the configured plan (Concept 7).
*   **Foundational Security & Simplicity:** Implementing necessary security for both roles and keeping initial agent/AI logic simple and directly tied to configuration (Concept 9, 10).

The aim is an MVP that demonstrates the core loop: Expert configures -> Client sees personalized budget/goals based on config & $2618 income -> AI provides simple, config-driven support -> Expert monitors progress.

## 5. Deep Dive: Top 10 Refined Concepts (Configurable Counseling Focus)

These concepts form the basis of an MVP for the configurable AI counseling tool:

### Concept 1: Core MVP: Expert Config Portal + Client Budget View
*   **Statement:** The absolute minimum viable product. Includes a secure web portal where the expert (father) can select a client (dad) and configure: 1) Target Savings Rate (as % of ~$5670 monthly disposable income), 2) One Priority Savings Goal (e.g., text field), 3) AI Tone (e.g., choice of 'Coach' or 'Assistant'). The client application then displays a budget reflecting these settings, based on their processed $2618 income and fixed costs.
*   **Breakdown:** Requires expert auth, basic client selection UI, config input form (React), backend service/DB to store config (NestJS/PostgreSQL), client-side logic to fetch config and display resulting budget.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Directly enables the father to set initial parameters based on his assessment of the dad's needs and the $2618 income constraints.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Very limited initial configuration; client interaction is primarily viewing the budget.

### Concept 2: `ClientConfiguration` Service & DB Schema
*   **Statement:** Dedicated backend infrastructure (NestJS service, PostgreSQL tables) responsible for securely storing, retrieving, and updating the expert-defined configuration parameters for each client. Links configuration data to the client's user record.
*   **Breakdown:** `ClientConfiguration` entity/table linked to `User`. Fields for `targetSavingsRate` (float), `priorityGoalText` (string), `aiTone` (enum: 'COACH', 'ASSISTANT'). Service methods for `getConfig(clientId)`, `updateConfig(clientId, data)`.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** The central piece holding the father's specific strategy for the dad.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Requires careful schema design for future extensibility vs. MVP simplicity.

### Concept 3: Income/Fixed Cost Processor
*   **Statement:** A backend service that takes the client's stated income ($2618 bi-weekly), calculates a monthly baseline (~$5670), and allows input (or potentially identifies via transactions) major fixed costs specific to the scenario (mortgage, child support, orthodontics) to determine monthly disposable income available for configured budgeting.
*   **Breakdown:** Service method `calculateDisposableIncome(clientId)`. Needs inputs for income frequency/amount and fixed costs. Stores results perhaps linked to client profile.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Essential for grounding all configured percentages and targets in the dad's actual financial reality.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Reliably identifying *all* fixed costs automatically is hard; MVP likely needs manual input.

### Concept 4: Parameterized Budgeting Engine
*   **Statement:** The core service that generates the client's budget. It takes the disposable income (from Concept 3) and applies the rules/targets defined in the `ClientConfiguration` (Concept 2) - e.g., allocate `targetSavingsRate`% to savings, potentially distribute remaining funds based on simple ratios or historical data (if available).
*   **Breakdown:** Service method `generateBudget(clientId)`. Fetches config, disposable income. Applies rules. Returns budget structure (e.g., JSON object with category allocations).
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Translates the father's high-level strategy (via config) into a concrete budget plan for the dad's $5670/mo situation.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Initial version uses simple rules; complex AI allocation is deferred.

### Concept 5: Expert-Linked Goal Setting (Client)
*   **Statement:** A UI flow within the client application where the dad can view the priority goal set by the father (from config) and potentially add secondary personal goals. The UI subtly emphasizes the expert-defined goal.
*   **Breakdown:** Client UI component displaying `priorityGoalText` from config. Ability to add other goals stored separately. Backend endpoints to manage goals.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Aligns the dad's goal-setting activity with the father's guidance.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Limits client autonomy in goal prioritization for MVP to reinforce the counseling model.

### Concept 6: Configurable AI Tone/Style (Simple)
*   **Statement:** The AI's communication style in basic interactions (e.g., notifications from Concept 10) reflects the expert's choice ('Coach' vs. 'Assistant').
*   **Breakdown:** Pre-written text templates for notifications/alerts. Logic selects template based on `aiTone` field in `ClientConfiguration`. Requires PE to define the different tones.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Personalizes the AI interaction based on the father's assessment of what style suits the dad best.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Very basic implementation of 'tone'; only affects limited interactions in MVP.

### Concept 7: Expert Progress Summary Dashboard
*   **Statement:** A secure page in the expert portal showing a simple summary for a selected client (dad). Includes: adherence to configured budget categories (spending vs. target), progress towards the expert-defined priority goal, maybe last login date.
*   **Breakdown:** Expert portal UI component (React). Backend API endpoint aggregating necessary data (budget, spending, goal progress) securely. Careful data filtering to avoid showing raw transactions.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Allows the father to quickly check if the dad is generally following the plan derived from the $2618 income.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Provides limited insight in MVP; relies on accurate categorization.

### Concept 8: Explainability Referencing Expert
*   **Statement:** Where the AI presents information derived from the configuration, it explicitly references the expert. E.g., Budget view title: "Budget Plan based on [Father's Name]'s Guidance"; Goal view: "Priority Goal set by [Father's Name]: [Goal Text]".
*   **Breakdown:** Standardized text strings used in the client UI (React) that incorporate the expert's name (fetched from expert profile linked via config).
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Constantly reinforces the link between the tool and the trusted human counselor.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Requires careful wording to avoid sounding repetitive or robotic.

### Concept 9: Secure Authentication (Client & Expert)
*   **Statement:** Implementing robust authentication mechanisms for both the client application (dad) and the expert portal (father). MFA strongly recommended for the expert portal.
*   **Breakdown:** Using standard auth libraries (e.g., Passport.js in NestJS), implementing secure password storage, session management, and MFA flows for the expert role.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Essential for protecting sensitive financial data and configuration settings.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Adds development time but is non-negotiable.

### Concept 10: Basic Configurable Agent (Budget Monitor)
*   **Statement:** A simple background agent/scheduled task that periodically checks the client's spending in key categories against the *expert-configured budget*. If spending exceeds a configured threshold (perhaps another simple config parameter), it triggers a basic notification to the client, using the *configured AI tone*.
*   **Breakdown:** Scheduled task logic (NestJS). Fetches config (budget rules, threshold, tone), compares spending data. If threshold exceeded, sends data to notification service, specifying tone template.
*   **Scenario Relevance:** Provides proactive feedback to the dad based *specifically* on the plan the father set up for his $5670/mo budget.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Very simple agent logic; notification only, no complex insights.
