**Goal:** Synthesize initial concepts and refine the structure for a Prompt Mastery educational course tailored for ~200 software engineers, focusing on practical application within Cursor and leading towards advanced techniques.

**Facilitator:** Welcome everyone. We've all reviewed the goal – creating a 'Prompt Mastery' course for our software engineers, leveraging Cursor. We have 132 initial concepts covering everything from LLM theory and pedagogy to advanced agent design and practical Cursor usage. Let's synthesize these into a coherent course structure. First, the core curriculum – what's the MVP? PO, SSE, what delivers immediate value?

**PO:** The MVP absolutely needs to cover the basics of *what* prompts are, *why* they matter for engineers, and *how* to use them effectively for common tasks *within Cursor*. Things like code generation, explanation, debugging – the daily wins. We need to show immediate productivity gains to get buy-in from the 200 engineers.

**SSE:** Agreed. Focus on practical patterns: providing context from the editor (@-mentions, code selection), asking for specific outputs (code, docs, commit messages), iterating on a bad response from the AI. Less theory initially, more hands-on within Cursor. The "mastery" comes later, building on this foundation.

**PM:** From a rollout perspective, an MVP focused on core Cursor integration and basic-to-intermediate prompting is most feasible. We can measure adoption and initial feedback before launching complex modules. This manages risk and allows for iterative improvement based on user data.

**Facilitator:** Okay, solid MVP focus on practical Cursor integration for core SE tasks. Now, how do we balance the necessary underlying theory? AIR, Prof Ed, PR – how much 'why' is needed early on?

**AIR:** Some fundamentals are crucial for effective use and debugging. Understanding context windows (why did Cursor miss that function?), tokenization basics (why did it misunderstand that variable name?), and *why* techniques like CoT work helps engineers move beyond cargo-culting prompts. But keep it high-level initially, maybe linked directly to Cursor examples.

**Prof Ed:** We use scaffolding. Introduce concepts like tokenization *when* it becomes relevant to a practical problem they're solving in an exercise, maybe a debugging scenario in Cursor. Bloom's Taxonomy helps – start with Applying (using Cursor commands), then move to Analyzing (why a prompt failed) and Evaluating (choosing the right prompting strategy for a task).

**PR:** Exactly. Situated learning – learn the theory *in the context* of a realistic SE task within the IDE. Minimize cognitive load by not front-loading too much abstract theory. Dual coding theory supports this – visualize context windows or tokenization alongside the code/prompt example.

**PE:** From a prompt crafter's view, understanding *why* a technique works is key to adapting it to new problems. But agree, introduce it alongside practical examples. Show *how* knowing about tokenization helps write better prompts for code, maybe with specific Cursor examples of where it goes wrong.

**Facilitator:** Good alignment on integrating theory contextually, tied to practical SE tasks and Cursor behavior. Let's talk platform and Cursor integration. Ed UX, AI UX?

**Ed UX:** We need an interactive learning platform, whether bespoke or a well-customized LMS. An embedded Cursor simulation or a tightly integrated playground is non-negotiable for hands-on practice without fear of breaking things. Interactive visualizations for abstract concepts like agent loops or CoT branching are key for comprehension.

**AI UX:** The experience *in* Cursor is paramount for the intro/MVP. The course must mirror that workflow. Clarity on context provision (@-mentions, code selection), interpreting diffs, handling errors – these are core UX challenges addressable through good prompting taught in the course. Trust is built by the AI showing its 'thinking' (CoT outputs) and prompts that help engineers guide the AI to acknowledge limitations or ask clarifying questions.

**SSE:** The playground idea is great for safe experimentation. But many exercises need realistic context. Can we use anonymized snippets from our actual codebases or very representative open-source examples relevant to our tech stack?

**Ed UX:** Absolutely, the platform should support loading realistic code context for exercises. We also need excellent feedback UX – when a prompt exercise fails, provide constructive hints, not just 'wrong'.

**Facilitator:** Interactive platform, integrated playground/simulation, visualizations, realistic SE context, and robust feedback loops seem key. Now, the 'Mastery' part – AOA, AAE? How deep do we go on advanced orchestration and agents for this audience?

**AOA:** For a broad audience of 200 engineers, full agent orchestration might be niche. Focus on *workflows*. Teach prompt chaining explicitly, basic RAG patterns for pulling in relevant documentation or code context, and maybe meta-prompting for generating complex configurations or test plans. These are powerful extensions of prompting applicable to many SE tasks.

**AAE:** Agree. Cover agent *concepts* like the Observe-Think-Act loop, the role of prompting in planning and tool use, and memory concepts conceptually. But building complex autonomous agents is likely beyond the core scope. A capstone project involving a simple 'agentic helper' – e.g., a multi-step documentation generator that reads code, summarizes, and formats – using prompt chaining and maybe basic tool use (like calling a linter via prompt) seems like an appropriate 'mastery' goal.

**PE:** The advanced track must cover advanced context engineering for large files/projects, robust output formatting techniques, prompt debugging strategies for complex failures, and methods for evaluating different prompt strategies for non-trivial tasks like complex refactoring or designing system components.

**AIR:** Introduce emerging techniques (ToT, Reflexion) conceptually in the advanced modules, explaining their potential benefits and tradeoffs. Also critically important is covering evaluation – how do engineers *know* if the complex output is good? Introduce code quality metrics, security checks, and human evaluation frameworks they can apply.

**Facilitator:** Makes sense. Mastery involves advanced *prompting* techniques applied within the SE workflow (chaining, RAG, advanced context/output control), potentially culminating in simple agentic helper projects. What about pedagogy and assessment, Prof Ed, PR?

**Prof Ed:** Project-based learning for advanced modules is definitely the way to go. Use authentic assessments mimicking real SE challenges solvable with sophisticated prompting in Cursor. Throughout the course, use frequent, low-stakes formative assessments – maybe short prompt design tasks, critiquing AI outputs, debugging a faulty prompt chain.

**PR:** Error analysis is crucial – teach debugging prompts as a core skill. Can we build course features that encourage Self-Regulated Learning, like prompts asking engineers to predict the outcome before running, or reflect on why a prompt failed? Measuring transfer is key – are they *applying* these skills? We could look at aggregate, anonymized Cursor usage patterns (e.g., complexity of prompts used) or encourage peer review of prompts used for specific tasks.

**Ed UX:** The platform needs to support these: code submissions, potentially automated checks for prompt outputs, peer review workflows. Feedback needs to be specific and link back to the concepts taught.

**Facilitator:** Finally, rollout and logistics. PM?

**PM:** Phased rollout is essential, starting with a pilot group representing different teams/experience levels. Need clear success metrics tied back to the PO's value prop – Cursor adoption, feature usage, self-reported productivity, perhaps even qualitative analysis of prompt complexity over time. A huge risk is content becoming outdated; we need a clear maintenance plan involving SMEs. Internal marketing needs to be strong, highlighting the practical benefits for engineers in their daily work.

**PO:** We must collect success stories early from the pilot to build momentum and demonstrate ROI. This needs alignment with engineering leadership – it's an investment in productivity and future capability. The course needs to feel integrated with our engineering culture, not just another mandatory training.

**Facilitator:** Excellent discussion. Key themes reaffirmed: Practical MVP focused on Cursor integration for core SE tasks, theory introduced contextually, interactive platform with realistic context and playground, mastery involving advanced SE-focused prompting workflows (chaining, RAG, debugging) potentially culminating in simple agentic projects, strong emphasis on authentic assessment & feedback, and a managed rollout with clear metrics, maintenance plan, and strong internal communication. We have a solid direction to refine our top 20 concepts.
