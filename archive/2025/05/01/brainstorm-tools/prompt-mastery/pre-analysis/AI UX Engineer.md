# AI UX Engineer - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** AI UX Engineer (AI UX)

Focusing on the user experience of interacting with AI systems, especially within tools like Cursor:

1.  **Designing for Conversational Interfaces (Chat):** Best practices for crafting prompts in a chat context (clarity, context carryover, managing expectations) specifically within Cursor.
2.  **Human-AI Collaboration Patterns:** Explore different models of interaction (AI as assistant, collaborator, autonomous tool) and how prompt design facilitates these patterns in a software engineering context.
3.  **Reducing Interaction Friction:** Prompting techniques that minimize the effort required from the engineer to get useful results (e.g., effective use of context, default assumptions, anticipating needs).
4.  **Trust & Transparency in AI Interactions:** How prompt structure and AI responses (e.g., showing reasoning via CoT, explaining limitations) can build user trust and transparency.
5.  **Handling Ambiguity & Errors Gracefully:** Designing prompts and interaction flows that help the AI (and user) recover from misunderstandings or errors (e.g., clarification prompts, suggesting alternatives).
6.  **Personalization & Adaptability:** Concepts for prompts that adapt to individual engineer preferences, coding styles, or common tasks within Cursor.
7.  **Cognitive Load of Prompting:** Analyze the mental effort involved in complex prompt engineering and suggest techniques or UI aids (within Cursor or the course) to manage this load.
8.  **Usability Heuristics for AI Prompts:** Adapting Nielsen's heuristics (or similar principles) to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of prompts and AI interactions.
9.  **Feedback Loops & Continuous Improvement:** Designing mechanisms for engineers to easily provide feedback on the quality of AI responses/prompts, potentially feeding into prompt refinement.
10. **Onboarding & Learnability:** How to design the initial learning experience within the course to make prompt engineering concepts accessible and easy to grasp for busy engineers.
11. **Visualizing AI Output within IDE:** Explore how AI outputs (code suggestions, explanations, diffs) are presented in Cursor and how prompts can influence the clarity and usefulness of this presentation.
12. **Ethical UX Considerations:** Prompting practices related to fairness, bias mitigation, and ensuring the AI interaction respects user autonomy and privacy within their workflow.
