# Product Owner - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** Product Owner (PO)

Focusing on the value proposition, target audience needs, and overall vision for the course as a product:

1.  **Course Value Proposition:** Clearly define the key benefits for engineers (e.g., increased productivity, higher code quality, ability to tackle complex problems faster) and the business (e.g., faster development cycles, innovation).
2.  **Target Audience Needs Analysis:** Deep dive into the specific pain points and opportunities for the 200 software engineers that this course can address via AI and prompt engineering within Cursor.
3.  **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Course:** Define the essential core modules and features for an initial launch, focusing on delivering immediate value (e.g., Basic Prompting + Cursor Integration).
4.  **Course Roadmap & Prioritization:** Develop a longer-term roadmap for adding advanced modules (Agentic AI, Orchestration, Dynamic Prompts) based on user feedback and evolving needs.
5.  **User Stories for Learning Objectives:** Frame learning objectives as user stories (e.g., "As a software engineer, I want to learn CoT prompting so that I can effectively debug complex code blocks using Cursor").
6.  **Defining "Mastery":** Clarify what level of proficiency constitutes "mastery" in this context and how the course will get engineers there. Is it expert-level or highly proficient application?
7.  **Integration with Engineering Workflow:** Ensure course content and examples are directly relevant to the actual tools, processes, and types of tasks engineers perform daily.
8.  **Measuring ROI/Business Value:** Propose methods to track the impact of the course on key business metrics (beyond individual completion rates).
9.  **Competitive Landscape (Internal/External):** Briefly assess if similar training exists internally or externally and how this course offers unique value (e.g., specific focus on Cursor, tailored examples).
10. **Course "Brand" & Positioning:** How should the course be perceived internally? As essential training? An optional skill boost? Cutting-edge development?
11. **Success Stories & Use Cases:** Plan to collect and showcase concrete examples of how engineers successfully applied course learnings to their projects.
12. **Cross-functional Alignment:** Ensure the course vision aligns with broader company goals related to AI adoption, developer productivity, and innovation.
