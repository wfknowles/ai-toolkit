# Pedagogy Researcher - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** Pedagogy Researcher (PR)

Focusing on the science of teaching and learning, specifically how engineers learn complex technical skills:

1.  **Cognitive Load Theory Application:** Structure content to minimize extraneous cognitive load (e.g., clear explanations, consistent examples) and maximize germane load (deep processing of prompt engineering concepts).
2.  **Dual Coding Theory:** Combine textual explanations with visual aids (diagrams of prompt flows, agent interactions, context management) to improve understanding and retention.
3.  **Problem-Solving Skills Transfer:** Design exercises that explicitly bridge the gap between learning prompt techniques in isolation and applying them to novel, complex software engineering problems within Cursor.
4.  **Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) Support:** Embed tools or prompts within the course that encourage engineers to set goals, monitor their understanding, and adjust their learning strategies.
5.  **Error Analysis as Learning:** Frame prompt failures not as mistakes, but as learning opportunities. Include modules on common pitfalls and debugging strategies.
6.  **Spaced Repetition & Interleaving:** Structure the curriculum to revisit key concepts at increasing intervals (spacing) and mix different types of prompting problems (interleaving) to enhance long-term recall.
7.  **Community of Practice Model:** Facilitate the creation of an internal community where engineers can share successful prompts, discuss challenges, and learn from each other post-course.
8.  **Measuring Learning Transfer:** Propose methods to assess not just knowledge acquisition, but whether engineers actually *apply* the learned prompt engineering skills effectively in their daily work (e.g., analyzing Cursor usage patterns, peer code reviews focusing on AI interaction).
9.  **Andragogy Principles (Adult Learning):** Ensure the course respects adult learners by being relevant to their work, problem-centered, self-directed (where possible), and drawing on their existing engineering experience.
10. **Situated Learning Theory:** Emphasize learning within authentic contexts. Use real (anonymized) codebases or realistic project scenarios for exercises and examples.
11. **Feedback Specificity & Timing:** Research and recommend best practices for providing feedback on prompt quality â€“ should it be immediate? Delayed? Peer-based? AI-generated? Tailor feedback to the learning objective.
12. **Conceptual Change Model:** Identify potential misconceptions engineers might have about AI or prompting (e.g., AI as magic) and design instruction to explicitly address and correct these.
