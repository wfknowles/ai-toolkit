# Prompt Engineer - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** Prompt Engineer (PE)

Focusing on the craft of designing, refining, and evaluating prompts:

1.  **Fundamentals of Prompt Structure:** Elements of a good prompt: role, instruction, context, examples (few-shot), output format specification.
2.  **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting:** Understanding when and how to use each, including crafting effective examples for few-shot learning, especially for coding tasks.
3.  **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Deep Dive:** Practical application of Zero-Shot and Few-Shot CoT for complex reasoning, debugging, and code explanation within Cursor.
4.  **Iterative Prompt Refinement Cycle:** The process of testing a prompt, analyzing the output, identifying flaws, and iteratively improving the prompt for better results.
5.  **Advanced Prompting Techniques Overview:** Introduction to techniques like Self-Consistency, ToT, ReAct, Meta-Prompting, Prompt Chaining â€“ focusing on *how* to construct prompts for these techniques.
6.  **Prompt Debugging & Analysis:** How to troubleshoot failing prompts. Is the instruction unclear? Is context missing? Is the model hallucinating? Techniques for isolating the problem.
7.  **Context Engineering:** Strategies for effectively selecting and formatting context (code snippets, documentation, error messages) to provide to the LLM within Cursor's limitations.
8.  **Output Formatting & Constraints:** Techniques for prompting the LLM to produce output in specific formats (JSON, markdown, specific code styles) and adhere to constraints (word count, specific libraries).
9.  **Prompt Templates & Reusability:** Creating and managing a library of effective prompt templates for common software engineering tasks.
10. **Evaluating Prompt Quality:** Metrics and heuristics for judging the effectiveness of a prompt beyond just getting a correct answer (e.g., efficiency, robustness, clarity of output).
11. **Understanding Model Behavior & Limitations:** Developing an intuition for how different models (if multiple are available via Cursor) respond to prompts and their inherent limitations (e.g., knowledge cutoffs, biases).
12. **Prompt Injection & Security Awareness:** Recognizing potential security risks associated with poorly designed prompts or handling untrusted input within prompts.
