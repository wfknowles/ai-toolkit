# Project Manager - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** Project Manager (PM)

Focusing on the practical delivery, rollout, and management of the course:

1.  **Course Rollout Strategy:** Phased rollout plan (pilot group, then broader deployment) considering engineer workload and scheduling constraints.
2.  **Resource Allocation:** Identify necessary resources: platform costs, SME time for content creation/review, potential instructor time, support staff.
3.  **Success Metrics & KPIs:** Define measurable goals for the course (e.g., adoption rate of Cursor features, self-reported efficiency gains, course completion rates, qualitative feedback scores).
4.  **Stakeholder Management Plan:** Identify key stakeholders (engineering leadership, individual engineers, potentially HR/L&D) and plan communication and updates.
5.  **Curriculum Development Timeline:** Realistic project plan with milestones for content creation, platform setup, pilot testing, and full launch.
6.  **Risk Management:** Identify potential risks (low adoption, technical issues with platform, content becoming outdated quickly) and mitigation strategies.
7.  **Budget Estimation:** Develop a preliminary budget covering development, platform, maintenance, and potential instructor costs.
8.  **Change Management:** Plan for how to introduce this new skill set and tool (Cursor) into existing workflows, addressing potential resistance or skepticism.
9.  **Internal Marketing & Communication Plan:** How to effectively communicate the value proposition of the course and encourage participation among the 200 engineers.
10. **Content Maintenance & Update Strategy:** Plan for keeping the course content current as AI models, prompting techniques, and Cursor features evolve.
11. **Feedback Collection & Iteration Process:** Establish a formal process for collecting feedback post-launch and incorporating it into future course revisions.
12. **Integration with Existing Training:** Determine how this course fits within the broader landscape of internal training and development programs.
