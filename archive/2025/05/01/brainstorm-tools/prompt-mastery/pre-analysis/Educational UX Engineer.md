# Educational UX Engineer - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** Educational UX Engineer (Ed UX)

Focusing on the learning platform experience, interaction design, and usability for the engineers taking the course:

1.  **Interactive Learning Platform Design:** Propose a dedicated online platform (or integration with existing LMS) optimized for coding education, featuring embedded code editors, prompt playgrounds, and immediate feedback mechanisms.
2.  **Cursor Integration Showcase:** Design modules specifically demonstrating Cursor features *within* the learning environment, perhaps using embedded simulations or guided walkthroughs.
3.  **Visualizing Prompt Concepts:** Develop interactive visualizations or diagrams to explain abstract concepts like CoT branching, agent loops, context window management, or tokenization.
4.  **Hands-on Prompt Playground:** Create a safe, sandboxed environment within the course platform where engineers can experiment with prompts, test different models/settings, and see immediate results without impacting real projects.
5.  **Adaptive Learning Path Interface:** Design a user interface that allows engineers to navigate the curriculum based on their role, prior knowledge, or specific interests (e.g., focusing on code generation vs. debugging prompts).
6.  **Feedback & Error Handling UX:** Design clear, constructive feedback mechanisms for exercises. When prompts fail, the interface should provide helpful debugging hints or links to relevant concepts.
7.  **Progress Tracking & Gamification UI:** Design intuitive dashboards showing progress, completed modules, earned badges/points (if gamified), and personalized recommendations for next steps.
8.  **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure the learning platform and all course materials adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG) for engineers with disabilities.
9.  **Mobile/Responsive Design:** Consider if parts of the course content (e.g., concept explanations, quizzes) should be accessible and usable on mobile devices for flexible learning.
10. **Collaborative Tools Integration:** Design interfaces for group projects or pair programming exercises, potentially integrating with existing tools like Slack or Teams for communication.
11. **Resource Library UX:** Design an easily searchable and well-organized library of prompt examples, cheat sheets, links to external tools, and further reading materials.
12. **User Testing & Iteration Plan:** Propose a plan for usability testing of the course platform and content with a pilot group of engineers, iterating on the design based on feedback.
