# AI Researcher - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** AI Researcher (AIR)

Bringing a research-oriented perspective, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, current limitations, and future directions of LLMs and prompting:

1.  **LLM Architectures & Capabilities Overview:** High-level understanding of transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and how model scale impacts capabilities like reasoning and in-context learning relevant to prompting.
2.  **The "Why" Behind Prompting Techniques:** Explain the theoretical underpinnings or empirical observations that make techniques like CoT or Self-Consistency effective (e.g., allocating computational steps, reducing variance).
3.  **Tokenization Deep Dive:** Explain how tokenization works (e.g., BPE), its impact on model behavior (especially for code and rare words), and how it relates to prompt design limitations ("Lost in Tokenization").
4.  **Understanding Context Windows:** Explain the concept, limitations, and evolution of context windows, and their critical importance for context management in prompts, especially for large codebases.
5.  **Hallucinations & Factual Accuracy:** Discuss the phenomenon of LLM hallucination, why it happens, and prompting strategies aimed at improving factual accuracy and grounding responses (e.g., RAG, verification steps).
6.  **Adversarial Prompting & Robustness:** Explore research on prompt injection, jailbreaking, and other adversarial attacks. Discuss robustness of different prompting techniques.
7.  **Evaluation Metrics for LLM Responses:** Introduce metrics used in research to evaluate LLM outputs (BLEU, ROUGE for text; code-specific metrics like pass@k, execution accuracy; human evaluation frameworks).
8.  **The Limits of Prompt Engineering:** Discuss tasks or capabilities where prompt engineering alone is insufficient and fine-tuning or architectural changes might be necessary. Manage expectations.
9.  **Emerging Research in Prompting & Agents:** Overview of recent research trends, such as new agent architectures, alternative reasoning methods, multimodal prompting, or lifelong learning for agents.
10. **Bias & Fairness in LLMs:** Discuss how biases present in training data can manifest in LLM outputs (including code suggestions) and the challenges in mitigating these biases through prompting or other means.
11. **Explainability & Interpretability (XAI) for Prompts:** Explore the challenges and current research on understanding *why* an LLM produced a specific output given a prompt, linking to techniques like CoT.
12. **Future Trends in LLMs & AI:** Discussion on potential future developments (e.g., larger models, different architectures, tighter tool integration) and how they might impact prompt engineering practices.
