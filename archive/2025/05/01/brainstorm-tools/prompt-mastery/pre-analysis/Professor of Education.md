# Professor of Education - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** Professor of Education (Prof Ed)

Applying established educational theories and best practices to the course design:

1.  **Constructivist Learning Framework:** Design the course around active learning, problem-solving, and discovery, where engineers construct their understanding through hands-on prompting exercises.
2.  **Scaffolding Learning:** Structure the course from simple concepts (basic prompts, chat interaction) to complex ones (agentic workflows, dynamic prompting), providing support structures that are gradually removed.
3.  **Bloom's Taxonomy for Prompting:** Align course objectives and assessments with different cognitive levels: Remembering (basic syntax), Understanding (explaining techniques), Applying (using Cursor for tasks), Analyzing (debugging prompts), Evaluating (comparing prompt strategies), Creating (designing novel workflows).
4.  **Project-Based Learning (PBL) Core:** Center the advanced modules around substantial, realistic software engineering projects where participants apply diverse prompting techniques integrated with Cursor.
5.  **Collaborative Learning Modules:** Include pair-programming or small group activities where engineers work together on complex prompting challenges, fostering peer learning and discussion.
6.  **Formative Assessment Strategy:** Integrate frequent, low-stakes assessments (quizzes, short exercises, prompt critiques) to monitor understanding and provide feedback, rather than relying solely on summative exams.
7.  **Authentic Assessment:** Design assessments that mirror real-world software engineering tasks solvable with AI/Cursor (e.g., refactoring code, generating documentation, debugging complex issues via prompting).
8.  **Metacognitive Skill Development:** Explicitly teach engineers how to reflect on their own prompting process â€“ planning, monitoring effectiveness, and evaluating results.
9.  **Motivation & Engagement Strategies:** Incorporate elements of gamification (challenges, leaderboards for prompt efficiency?), showcase real-world success stories, and clearly link learning to improved job performance.
10. **Differentiated Instruction Considerations:** Offer optional advanced modules or challenges for faster learners and provide extra support or resources for those struggling with specific concepts.
11. **Instructor Training & Support:** Develop materials and potentially training for internal champions or instructors who might lead sessions or support colleagues.
12. **Long-Term Knowledge Retention Plan:** Include post-course resources, a community of practice, or periodic refresher activities to combat knowledge decay.
