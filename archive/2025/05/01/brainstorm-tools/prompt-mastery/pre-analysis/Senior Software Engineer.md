# Senior Software Engineer - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** Senior Software Engineer (SSE)

Bringing the perspective of an experienced practitioner who would be taking or benefiting from the course:

1.  **Practical Cursor Use Cases:** Focus on concrete, day-to-day SE tasks improved by Cursor + prompting: code generation (boilerplate, unit tests), debugging assistance, refactoring suggestions, documentation drafting, commit message generation, explaining complex code.
2.  **Code-Specific Prompting Patterns:** Techniques tailored for interacting with code: providing relevant code context effectively, prompting for specific languages/frameworks, asking for code explanations, requesting different implementation approaches.
3.  **Debugging AI-Generated Code:** How to critically evaluate code suggested by Cursor, identify potential bugs or inefficiencies, and prompt for corrections or alternative solutions.
4.  **Refactoring with AI Assistance:** Advanced prompts for guiding Cursor to perform complex refactoring tasks while preserving functionality (e.g., extracting methods, changing design patterns).
5.  **Integrating Prompts into Existing Workflows:** Showcasing how to incorporate prompting/Cursor seamlessly into development cycles (debugging sessions, code reviews, feature development) rather than as a separate step.
6.  **Context Management for Large Codebases:** Strategies for providing the *right* context from large projects when prompting Cursor, without exceeding context limits (e.g., using @-mentions, selecting relevant snippets).
7.  **Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness (for SE tasks):** How engineers can quickly assess if a prompt is yielding useful results for a coding task and iterate on the prompt if needed.
8.  **Advanced Code Generation Techniques:** Prompts for generating more complex outputs like API clients, database schemas, or configuration files based on specifications.
9.  **Performance Considerations:** Awareness of when AI assistance might be slower than manual coding and when it provides significant speedups. Understanding potential costs associated with heavy API usage (if applicable).
10. **Security Implications of AI Code:** Prompting for secure coding practices, being aware of potential vulnerabilities in AI-generated code, and *not* blindly trusting suggestions for sensitive operations.
11. **Customizing Cursor/Prompts:** Techniques for creating reusable prompt templates or custom commands within Cursor (if supported) for recurring tasks.
12. **Sharing Effective Prompts within Teams:** Mechanisms or best practices for engineers to share prompts that work well for specific types of problems or codebases.
