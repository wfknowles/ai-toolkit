# AI Agent Engineer - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** AI Agent Engineer (AAE)

Focusing on building and orchestrating autonomous or semi-autonomous AI systems:

1.  **Agent Architectures (e.g., ReAct, Reflexion):** Explain common agent loop patterns (Observe-Think-Act) and how prompting techniques enable reasoning and action planning within these loops.
2.  **Tool Use Integration & Prompting:** How to design prompts that effectively instruct agents to select and use external tools (APIs, databases, code execution) and integrate the results.
3.  **Memory Management for Agents:** Prompting techniques for managing short-term (context window) and long-term memory (vector databases, summarization) in agentic workflows.
4.  **Planning & Decomposition:** Advanced prompting strategies (like ToT or planning prompts) for agents to break down complex goals into manageable sub-tasks.
5.  **Multi-Agent Systems & Communication:** Concepts for designing prompts that enable communication and collaboration between multiple specialized agents.
6.  **State Management in Agentic Prompts:** Techniques for maintaining and updating the agent's internal state or understanding of the world through prompt interactions.
7.  **Error Handling & Recovery in Agents:** Prompting strategies for agents to recognize errors (tool failures, unexpected outputs), attempt recovery actions, or ask for human help.
8.  **Agent Evaluation & Debugging:** Techniques and prompts for testing agent performance, diagnosing failures in the reasoning loop, and understanding agent behavior.
9.  **Prompting for Agent Safety & Alignment:** Designing prompts with strong guardrails and constraints to ensure agents operate within desired ethical and safety boundaries.
10. **Dynamic Prompt Generation for Agents:** Concepts where agents modify their own prompts based on context, feedback, or progress towards a goal.
11. **Cursor as an Agentic Interface:** Frame Cursor not just as a chat tool, but as an interface for executing agentic workflows within the IDE context (e.g., multi-step refactoring, automated testing guided by prompts).
12. **Building a Simple Software Engineering Agent:** A capstone module where engineers design prompts to create a basic agent that can perform a specific task (e.g., automated documentation generation based on code changes).
