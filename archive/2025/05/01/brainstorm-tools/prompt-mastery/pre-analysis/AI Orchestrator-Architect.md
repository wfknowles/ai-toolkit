# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Initial Concepts for Prompt Mastery Course

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Persona:** AI Orchestrator/Architect (AOA)

Focusing on the system-level integration, workflow design, and architectural patterns involving prompts and LLMs:

1.  **Prompt Chaining & Workflow Orchestration:** Designing sequences of prompts where the output of one feeds into the next to accomplish complex tasks (beyond simple chat).
2.  **Meta-Prompting Strategies:** Techniques where prompts generate or refine other prompts based on context or user input, enabling dynamic adaptation.
3.  **Context Management Architectures:** Strategies for managing context across multiple prompts or turns, especially when dealing with large amounts of information (codebases, documents). Includes techniques like summarization, vector databases (RAG), and context distillation.
4.  **Agentic Workflow Design:** Architecting systems where LLMs act as agents, using prompts to drive planning, tool use, and interaction loops.
5.  **Model Selection for Tasks:** Understanding when different models (or even smaller, specialized models) might be better suited for specific sub-tasks within an orchestrated workflow, and how to prompt them effectively.
6.  **Error Handling & Fallbacks in Orchestration:** Designing robust prompt workflows that can handle errors from LLMs or tools, potentially retrying prompts or routing to fallback mechanisms.
7.  **API Integration & Tool Abstraction:** How to design prompts that reliably interact with external APIs or tools, including formatting requests and parsing responses.
8.  **Performance Optimization for Prompt Chains:** Techniques to minimize latency and cost in multi-step prompt workflows (e.g., parallel execution where possible, prompt caching).
9.  **Evaluating Orchestrated Systems:** Metrics and methods for evaluating the end-to-end performance and reliability of complex prompt-driven workflows.
10. **Security Considerations in Orchestration:** Protecting against prompt injection or data leakage across chained prompts and tool interactions.
11. **Scalability of Prompt-Based Systems:** Architectural considerations for building prompt-driven features that can scale to handle many users or complex requests.
12. **Domain-Specific Prompt Adaptation:** Strategies for tailoring generic prompting techniques and architectures to the specific domain of software engineering and the Cursor environment.
