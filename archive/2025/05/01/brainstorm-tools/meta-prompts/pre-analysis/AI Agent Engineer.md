# AI Agent Engineer - Brainstorming Pre-Analysis: Meta-Prompts & Modularity

**Focus:** Implementing & Evaluating Complex/Agentic Prompting Systems

**Concepts Brainstormed (9):**

1.  **Tool Use Validation Prompt:** Before executing a tool/adapter requested by the LLM (PE concept #3), use a validation prompt: "The AI requested tool `[ToolName]` with params `[params]`. Is this request valid, safe, and appropriate given the current goal `[goal context]`? Answer Yes/No with brief justification."
2.  **Dynamic Prompt Selection based on LLM Capability:** If multiple LLMs are available (e.g., cheap/fast vs. powerful/slow), the orchestrator (or a meta-LLM) selects the best prompt *template* and *target LLM* based on task complexity. Simple summaries use the cheap LLM; complex reasoning uses the powerful one.
3.  **Automated Prompt Evaluation & Comparison:** Framework to run multiple candidate prompts (or variations) for the same task against a golden dataset (AIE R3 concept). Automatically calculate metrics (accuracy, cost, latency, adherence to format) to identify the best performing prompt version.
4.  **Prompt Compression/Distillation:** Train a smaller, faster model (or use a simpler prompt with a cheaper LLM) to mimic the output of a complex, expensive prompt for common tasks, using the output of the expensive prompt as training data.
5.  **Context Engineering Pipeline:** Formalize the Context Management Service (Arch concept #2) into a configurable pipeline: Retrieve -> Chunk -> Embed -> Rank/Filter -> Format. Allows swapping different strategies for each step.
6.  **Failure Recovery Prompting:** When an AI task fails (e.g., invalid output format, tool error), trigger a specific recovery prompt: "The previous attempt failed [error details]. Analyze the failure and suggest a different approach or request clarification."
7.  **Planning Prompt with Intermediate Checkpoints:** For long-running agentic tasks, use a planning prompt: "Outline the steps needed to achieve [goal]." Then, execute step 1, feed result back to LLM: "Step 1 complete [result]. What is step 2?" Allows course correction.
8.  **Security Audit Prompt for Generated Code/Configs:** If AI generates code or configuration: "Analyze the generated [code/config snippet] for potential security vulnerabilities based on [OWASP Top 10 / Org Security Standards]."
9.  **Cross-Prompt Memory/State Management:** Mechanism for allowing information or decisions made in one AI prompt execution (e.g., user preference identified) to be stored and automatically injected into the context of *future*, related prompt executions within the same session or workflow.
