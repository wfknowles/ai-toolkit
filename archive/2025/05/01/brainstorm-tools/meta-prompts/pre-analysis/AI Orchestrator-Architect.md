# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Brainstorming Pre-Analysis: Meta-Prompts & Modularity

**Focus:** Orchestrating Modular/Dynamic Prompting Systems

**Concepts Brainstormed (9):**

1.  **Orchestration Flow Definition Language:** Define automation workflows (like dependency update) in a high-level language (YAML/DSL). Specify steps, conditions, adapter calls, and *which prompt configuration* (see PE concept #2) to use for AI analysis at specific points. The orchestrator parses this and executes the flow.
2.  **Context Management Service:** A dedicated service/module responsible for gathering, chunking, summarizing, and prioritizing context from various sources (code files, git history, docs, previous AI outputs) based on the current workflow step and the needs of the dynamically assembled prompt (PE concept #1/#6).
3.  **Dynamic Adapter Selection:** Based on project configuration or analysis (e.g., identifying `pom.xml` vs `package.json`), the orchestrator dynamically selects and loads the appropriate `PackageManagerAdapter` or `TestRunnerAdapter` implementation, injecting its specific tool schema (PE concept #3) into subsequent AI prompts if needed.
4.  **Prompt Strategy Pattern:** Implement different prompt strategies (e.g., `BasicAnalysis`, `DetailedSecurityReview`, `ConciseSummary`) as distinct classes/functions. The orchestrator selects the strategy based on user flags (`--detail=high`) or workflow logic, which then dictates which prompt fragments (PE concept #2) and context types (Concept #2 here) are assembled.
5.  **Stateful Multi-Turn Orchestration:** For complex tasks requiring back-and-forth with the AI (PE concept #5), the orchestrator manages the conversation state, passing relevant history (previous turns, critiques) back into the context builder for subsequent LLM calls.
6.  **Metadata Injection Framework:** Standardize how metadata (current step name, user ID, trace ID, project criticality level) is injected into prompt context, enabling prompts to tailor output or AI behavior based on this operational metadata.
7.  **Feedback Loop Integration Point:** Design specific points in the orchestration workflow where user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down on an AI suggestion, manual correction) can be captured and routed (potentially back to an evaluation dataset or a separate feedback store) to enable longer-term prompt/model improvement.
8.  **Conditional Prompt Execution:** Orchestration logic includes conditional execution of AI analysis prompts. E.g., only run the `analyze_test_failure` prompt if the `TestRunnerAdapter` reports failures; skip if tests pass.
9.  **Modular Output Handling:** The orchestrator receives output from the AI module (AIE) and routes it to different handlers based on type (summary text -> display module, JSON analysis -> processing module, critique -> feedback store). Decouples AI output from its consumption.
