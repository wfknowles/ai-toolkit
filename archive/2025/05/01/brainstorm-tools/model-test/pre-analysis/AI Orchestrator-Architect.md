# AI Orchestrator/Architect - Pre-Analysis: AI Model Test Concepts

**Objective:** Identify tests focused on integration capabilities, performance metrics, scalability, and suitability for complex, multi-step workflows.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **API Call Generation Test:** Ask the model to generate code snippets for calling specific internal or external APIs based on provided documentation (e.g., OpenAPI spec snippets, natural language description) and evaluate correctness and adherence to specs.
2.  **Structured Data Output Test (JSON/XML):** Test the model's reliability in generating complex, nested JSON or XML structures according to a specified schema, crucial for system integration.
3.  **Latency & Throughput Benchmark:** Measure response times (time-to-first-token, total generation time) and potential throughput (requests per second, where applicable) for typical task types (e.g., code generation, summarization) under varying load conditions (simulated).
4.  **Tool Use Integration Test:** If the model supports tool use (function calling), test its ability to correctly identify when to use a tool, format the request for the tool, and correctly interpret/utilize the tool's response within a larger workflow.
5.  **State Management Test (Multi-turn):** Engage the model in a multi-turn conversation requiring it to maintain state and context across turns (e.g., refining a design, debugging code step-by-step) to assess consistency and context retention.
6.  **Resource Consumption Analysis:** Where possible, estimate or measure the computational resources (e.g., memory, CPU/GPU usage, token counts) required for different types of tasks to understand cost implications and scaling requirements.
7.  **Modularity & Reusability Test:** Ask the model to break down a complex task into smaller, potentially reusable functions or components, evaluating the logical decomposition and potential for integration into larger systems.
8.  **Error Handling & Resilience Test:** Introduce simulated errors (e.g., provide invalid inputs, simulate API failure responses) and evaluate the model's ability to handle them gracefully (e.g., report errors clearly, suggest alternatives, retry with modifications).
9.  **Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration Test:** Provide domain-specific documentation or knowledge base snippets and test the model's ability to incorporate this information accurately into its responses for tasks within that domain.
