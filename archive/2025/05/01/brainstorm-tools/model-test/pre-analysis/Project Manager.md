# Project Manager - Pre-Analysis: AI Model Test Concepts

**Objective:** Identify tests focused on task breakdown, estimation, dependency identification, summarization, and communication assistance.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Task Decomposition Test:** Provide a high-level feature description or user story and ask the model to break it down into smaller, actionable technical tasks suitable for assignment.
2.  **Effort Estimation Assistance Test:** Provide descriptions of technical tasks and ask the model to provide rough effort estimates (e.g., in story points, T-shirt sizes, or time ranges based on defined scales), potentially requiring calibration first. Evaluate the reasonableness and consistency of estimates.
3.  **Dependency Identification Test:** Give the model a list of tasks or features and ask it to identify potential dependencies between them (technical or logical).
4.  **Risk Identification Test:** Provide a project plan snippet or feature description and ask the model to identify potential risks or roadblocks (technical, resource, or schedule-related).
5.  **Summarization Test (Technical Docs/Meetings):** Provide lengthy technical documents, meeting transcripts, or discussion threads and ask the model to generate concise summaries, extracting key decisions and action items.
6.  **Status Update Generation Test:** Provide context about task progress and ask the model to draft a status update suitable for stakeholders, evaluating clarity, conciseness, and tone.
7.  **Resource Allocation Suggestion Test:** Given a list of tasks with estimated efforts and a list of available (hypothetical) team members with skillsets, ask the model to suggest a possible allocation plan.
8.  **Project Scheduling Assistance Test:** Provide tasks with dependencies and estimates and ask the model to suggest a potential sequence or timeline (Gantt chart description, critical path analysis).
9.  **Communication Drafting Test (e.g., Emails, Announcements):** Ask the model to draft communications for common PM scenarios (e.g., meeting request, change announcement, risk escalation) based on provided context. Evaluate effectiveness and tone.
