# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis: AI Model Test Concepts

**Objective:** Identify tests focused on code quality, correctness, maintainability, integration with existing codebases, and debugging assistance.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Code Generation Correctness Test:** Provide specific programming problems (e.g., algorithms, data structure implementations, specific logic) and evaluate the functional correctness of the generated code through execution and unit tests.
2.  **Code Style & Readability Test:** Assess generated code against project-specific or standard style guides (e.g., PEP 8, Google Style Guide) for formatting, naming conventions, and overall readability.
3.  **Idiomatic Code Usage Test:** Evaluate whether the generated code uses language features and standard libraries in conventional and idiomatic ways for the target language.
4.  **Refactoring Capability Test:** Provide existing code snippets with known issues (e.g., duplication, inefficiency, poor structure) and ask the model to refactor them, evaluating the quality and correctness of the improvements.
5.  **Debugging Assistance Test:** Provide code snippets with bugs and ask the model to identify the cause, explain the issue, and suggest correct fixes. Evaluate the accuracy and clarity of the diagnosis and solution.
6.  **API/Library Usage Accuracy Test:** Ask the model to generate code that uses specific libraries or frameworks (e.g., React, Pandas, Spring Boot) and evaluate whether it uses the APIs correctly according to their documentation.
7.  **Test Case Generation Test:** Provide a function or module and ask the model to generate relevant unit tests (e.g., covering edge cases, typical usage, error conditions). Evaluate the quality, coverage, and correctness of the generated tests.
8.  **Code Documentation Generation Test:** Ask the model to generate documentation (e.g., docstrings, comments) for existing code snippets and evaluate its accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
9.  **Integration with Existing Code Test:** Provide a snippet of existing code and ask the model to add a new feature or modify existing logic that requires understanding and integrating with the surrounding context. Evaluate the seamlessness and correctness of the integration.
