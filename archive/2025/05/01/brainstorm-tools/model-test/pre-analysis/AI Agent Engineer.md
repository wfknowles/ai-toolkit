# AI Agent Engineer - Pre-Analysis: AI Model Test Concepts

**Objective:** Identify tests focused on the model's ability to function as part of a larger agentic system, including planning, tool use, self-correction, and reasoning capabilities.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Planning & Decomposition Test:** Give the model a complex goal requiring multiple steps or tool uses and evaluate its ability to generate a coherent plan or sequence of actions.
2.  **Tool Selection Accuracy Test:** In scenarios with multiple available tools, test the model's ability to select the most appropriate tool(s) for a given sub-task or information need.
3.  **Robust Tool Use & Error Handling Test:** Test how the model handles failures or unexpected responses from tools. Does it retry, try alternative tools, or report the failure clearly?
4.  **Information Gathering Strategy Test:** Provide a task requiring information not present in the initial context and evaluate the model's strategy for gathering it (e.g., asking clarifying questions, using search tools).
5.  **Self-Correction / Reflection Test:** Introduce deliberate errors into the model's plan or output and test its ability to identify and correct them when prompted or through internal reflection mechanisms (if supported).
6.  **Chain-of-Thought / Reasoning Transparency Test:** Evaluate the model's ability to output its reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought) for complex tasks, allowing for debugging and understanding of the agent's decision-making process.
7.  **Goal Adherence & Focus Test:** In long-running tasks, test if the agent stays focused on the overall goal or gets sidetracked by intermediate steps or irrelevant information.
8.  **Dynamic Re-planning Test:** Introduce unexpected information or changes in constraints during a task and evaluate the agent's ability to adapt its plan accordingly.
9.  **Integration with Memory/Knowledge Base Test:** Test the model's ability to effectively store and retrieve information from a simulated short-term or long-term memory/vector database as part of an agentic workflow.
