# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis: AI Model Test Concepts

**Objective:** Identify tests focused on understanding requirements, aligning with user value, handling ambiguity in business terms, and generating user-facing content.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Requirement Understanding Test:** Provide user stories or feature requirements in natural language and ask the model to outline implementation steps, identify potential ambiguities, or generate pseudo-code. Evaluate alignment with the core requirement.
2.  **Acceptance Criteria Validation Test:** Given a requirement and acceptance criteria, ask the model to generate test cases or scenarios that would satisfy those criteria. Evaluate the relevance and coverage of the generated scenarios.
3.  **User Value Alignment Test:** Present a business goal (e.g., "Increase user engagement") and ask the model to suggest features or improvements, evaluating the relevance and potential impact of its suggestions on the stated goal.
4.  **Business Terminology Test:** Use domain-specific business jargon within prompts (related to the PO's product area) and assess if the model correctly interprets and uses these terms in its responses.
5.  **User-Facing Content Generation Test (e.g., FAQs, UI Text):** Ask the model to generate text for user interfaces, help documents, or marketing copy based on feature descriptions. Evaluate clarity, tone, and appropriateness for the target audience.
6.  **Edge Case Identification Test:** Provide a standard user flow or requirement and ask the model to identify potential edge cases, error conditions, or alternative scenarios that need consideration.
7.  **Prioritization Rationale Test:** Give the model a list of features or tasks and ask it to suggest a prioritization order based on provided criteria (e.g., value, effort, dependencies). Evaluate the logic and justification behind its suggestions.
8.  **Generating User Personas/Scenarios Test:** Ask the model to create user personas based on descriptions or generate detailed usage scenarios for a given feature to test its ability to model user behavior and needs.
9.  **Competitive Analysis Test:** Provide information about competing products/features and ask the model to summarize key differentiators or suggest areas for improvement for the PO's product.
