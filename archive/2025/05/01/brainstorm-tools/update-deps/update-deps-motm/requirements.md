# AI Dependency Update Assistant - V1 Requirements & Guidelines

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Source:** MotM Round 2 Group Interview (`.../round-2/sme-group-interview.md`)

This document lists the high-level requirements, guidelines, and associated acceptance criteria (implied or explicit) for the Version 1 (V1) implementation of the AI Dependency Update Assistant CLI tool.

## Core Requirements (MUST)

1.  **Provide Core Commands**
    *   **Requirement:** The CLI tool MUST provide `scan` and `update` commands.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** `depup scan` and `depup update` commands exist and execute core functionality; `depup help` documents them.
2.  **Execute Updates on Branch**
    *   **Requirement:** The `update` command MUST execute updates on a separate Git branch.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Running `depup update` successfully creates a new branch (e.g., `depup-update/...`); dependency changes are committed only to this branch.
3.  **Execute Configured Tests**
    *   **Requirement:** The CLI MUST execute the user-configured test command after updates.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The command specified in the configuration's `testCommand` field is executed after dependencies are updated on the branch; test success/failure is reported.
4.  **Require User Confirmation**
    *   **Requirement:** The CLI MUST require user confirmation before applying dependency changes (or other potentially impactful actions).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The `update` workflow includes a [y/N] prompt before modifying `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/etc. or running `npm install`/`pip install`.
5.  **Provide Rollback Instructions**
    *   **Requirement:** The CLI MUST provide a clear command/instructions for rollback on failure (e.g., test failure).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** If the `update` workflow fails after creating a branch and making changes (e.g., tests fail), the output includes instructions like `git checkout [original_branch] && git branch -D [depup_branch]` or similar.
6.  **Support Initial Ecosystem**
    *   **Requirement:** V1 MUST support either Node.js (npm/yarn) OR Python (pip) ecosystem end-to-end (pending PO decision).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The chosen ecosystem works for the full `scan` and `update` workflow using relevant package managers and lockfiles.
7.  **Perform Core Scans**
    *   **Requirement:** V1 MUST perform vulnerability scanning and license checking using configurable tools/sources.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** `depup scan` successfully invokes configured vulnerability scanner (via adapter) and license checker (via adapter); results are incorporated into the summary report.
8.  **Support CI Mode**
    *   **Requirement:** The CLI MUST be runnable in a non-interactive mode suitable for CI (e.g., `scan --ci`).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** `depup scan --ci --output report.json` runs without prompts and outputs a structured report (e.g., JSON) containing essential scan summaries (Vuln counts, License status) suitable for pipeline checks (PA Interview point).
9.  **Secure Tool Execution**
    *   **Requirement:** All external tool execution MUST use secure practices (safe APIs, no shell=True if possible).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Code review confirms subprocess calls avoid shell injection vulnerabilities; inputs passed to tools are appropriately sanitized/escaped where necessary.

## Key Guidelines (SHOULD / MUST for specific assets)

1.  **Modular Architecture**
    *   **Guideline:** Architecture SHOULD be modular (Orchestrator, Adapters, AI Module) to facilitate extension.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Codebase demonstrates clear separation of concerns between core orchestration logic, tool-specific adapters, and AI interaction components; interfaces are defined.
2.  **Decoupled AI**
    *   **Guideline:** AI integration SHOULD be decoupled, allowing core function without LLM calls.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A mechanism exists (e.g., `--no-ai` flag or configuration) to run the core update workflow relying only on deterministic tool outputs; core functionality (scan, update, test) completes successfully in this mode.
3.  **Accessible Output**
    *   **Guideline:** CLI output SHOULD follow accessibility best practices (redundant cues, no reliance on color alone).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** CLI output does not rely solely on color for conveying information; provides text labels or icons with fallbacks; includes a `--no-color` option.
4.  **Minimal Configuration**
    *   **Guideline:** Configuration SHOULD be minimal, with sensible defaults.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool functions with only the essential configurations (e.g., `testCommand`) provided; other settings have reasonable defaults; configuration process is documented and simple.
5.  **Clear Documentation**
    *   **Guideline:** Documentation (README) MUST clearly explain installation, configuration, usage, and limitations (esp. AI analysis accuracy).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** README.md exists and covers installation steps, how to configure `testCommand` and other key options, examples of `scan` and `update` usage, how to interpret output, and explicitly states the heuristic nature of AI analysis in V1.
6.  **Automated Testing**
    *   **Guideline:** Automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) MUST cover core workflows and adapter functionality.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Test suite exists and includes unit tests for core modules, integration tests for tool adapters, and end-to-end tests for the primary `scan` and `update` scenarios.
7.  **Agile Development**
    *   **Guideline:** Development SHOULD follow chosen Agile methodology with regular feedback loops.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Project tasks are tracked (e.g., Jira board); regular sprint ceremonies (planning, review, retro) are held; feedback mechanisms are in place.
