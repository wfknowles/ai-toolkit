# Senior Software Engineer - MotM Round 1 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Senior Software Engineer (SSE)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**(Facilitator):** Thanks for your analysis focusing on the practical developer aspects. You raised key concerns about the accuracy of breaking change analysis (#2), the quality of AI explanations (#14), and reliance on test suites (#3).

**(Facilitator):** Let's talk about breaking change analysis (#2). You noted its potential inaccuracy. Do you see *any* value in an AI attempting this analysis, or is it too unreliable to be useful?

**(SSE):** There's value, but it needs to be positioned correctly. It shouldn't be presented as a definitive "this update is safe" guarantee. It should be framed as a "best effort analysis to *highlight potential areas of concern* for human review." Its value lies in pointing the developer to the *most likely* places where an update *might* cause issues (e.g., changed function signatures used in the code, major version bumps in critical paths). It's a starting point for investigation, not the end point. Focusing on concrete API changes (#3 refinement) is more reliable than trying to interpret semantic meaning from changelogs.

**(Facilitator):** You suggested mandating human review for major updates (#1 refinement). How do we balance that necessary caution with the goal of streamlining the update process? Doesn't that negate some of the automation benefits?

**(SSE):** It's a trade-off. For trivial patch updates or minor updates with no flagged breaking changes (#2) and passing tests (#3), maybe the process can be highly automated (e.g., auto-create PR from branch #11). But for major version bumps, especially of core frameworks or libraries, the risk of subtle, hard-to-test breakages is too high to skip human review. The AI assistant streamlines the *information gathering* and *initial checking* (scans, tests, basic analysis), saving significant developer time there. The final sign-off for high-risk changes should remain human. It's about augmenting the developer, not replacing their judgment on critical changes.

**(Facilitator):** If you were building this, how would you want the automated testing (#3) and code analysis (#2) results presented to you as a developer?

**(SSE):** Concisely first, details on demand (UXE principle #2 refinement). 
1.  **Summary:** Clear Pass/Fail from tests (#3). Number of *potential* breaking changes flagged (#2). Number/Severity of vulns (#1).
2.  **Test Failures:** If tests fail, list the failing tests and link directly to logs.
3.  **Breaking Changes:** List the flagged dependencies. For each, show the specific potential issue (e.g., "Function `X` removed", "Param type changed for `Y`") and *crucially*, link directly to the lines of code in *our project* that use that function/API (Related to SSE-8 initial idea).
4.  **Vulnerabilities:** Link CVEs to details. Show the dependency path (direct or transitive #12).
Essentially, give me the headlines, then make it easy to jump straight to the relevant code or detailed report for investigation.

**(Facilitator):** What unknown unknowns exist from your perspective? What could go unexpectedly wrong for a developer using this tool?

**(SSE):** The biggest unknown is the interaction with complex build systems or unconventional project structures. Can it correctly identify the test command (#3), parse dependencies (#9), and analyze code usage (#2) in projects with multiple sub-modules, custom build scripts, or generated code? Another unknown is subtle performance regressions (your SSE weakness point) â€“ functional tests (#3) won't catch that an update made a critical operation 10x slower. Finally, the tool might encourage blindly accepting updates if tests pass, leading to technical debt if underlying architectural changes needed for the update are ignored.

**(Facilitator):** Any major blindspots in the Top 15 from a day-to-day coding perspective?

**(SSE):** The lack of performance consideration is a notable one, as mentioned. Also, while it helps with *updating*, it doesn't explicitly address dependency *addition* hygiene (e.g., guiding selection of new packages based on quality, maintenance, security) or *removal* (identifying unused dependencies). It's focused narrowly on the update flow.

**(Facilitator):** Good point. Any missing SMEs you'd add?

**(SSE):** Maybe developers with deep expertise in specific ecosystems (e.g., a Node expert, a Java expert, a Ruby expert). Dependency management nuances, tooling, and common pitfalls vary significantly between ecosystems. Their input would be vital for making the analysis (#2, #4) and tool integration (#3, #9, #15) robust for specific languages/platforms.

**(Facilitator):** Excellent points on positioning the analysis, balancing automation with review, the importance of actionable reporting, and ecosystem-specific nuances. Thank you.
