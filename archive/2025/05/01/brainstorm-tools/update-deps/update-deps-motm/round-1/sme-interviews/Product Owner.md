# Product Owner - MotM Round 1 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Product Owner (PO)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**(Facilitator):** Thanks for your pre-analysis. You focused on connecting technical updates to product value and risk, managing visibility for planning, and potential UX impacts.

**(Facilitator):** You noted the Urgency/Risk indicator (#13) is technical and lacks business context (#1 refinement). How critical is adding that business context? Is it feasible for users to provide it reliably?

**(PO):** It's quite critical for effective prioritization from a product perspective. A critical technical vulnerability (#1) in a non-critical internal service has lower *business* urgency than a medium vulnerability in the payment processing module. Feasibility? It likely requires one-time configuration per project, mapping key modules/features to business criticality levels (e.g., "auth: critical", "reporting: high", "admin-tool: medium"). The AI could then use this mapping when presenting the risk (#13). Users wouldn't provide it per-run, but maintain it as project metadata.

**(Facilitator):** You also raised the lack of user-facing impact assessment (original PO-5) and suggested flagging updates to UI libraries (#2 refinement). Do you anticipate friction if the tool flags too many things for PO/UX review?

**(PO):** There's a balance. We don't want noise. But updates to major UI component libraries, core performance-sensitive dependencies, or libraries handling key user workflows *do* warrant a heads-up. The friction is manageable if the flagging is reasonably accurate (i.e., it correctly identifies UI libraries) and presented as a "recommend review" rather than a blocker. It allows Product/UX to proactively check for subtle visual regressions or performance changes before release.

**(Facilitator):** If you were using this tool's output to inform your backlog and roadmap, what would the ideal report or summary (#10) look like for you?

**(PO):** Ideal report would group updates by:
1.  **Urgency/Business Impact:** (Using #13 + #1 refinement) - e.g., Critical Security affecting Payments, High Risk affecting Auth, Medium License issue, Low technical debt update.
2.  **Estimated Effort:** (Using #3 refinement) - Trivial, Small, Medium, Large effort indicators.
3.  **Feature Linkage:** (Using #4 refinement) - Which upcoming features might this update enable or block?
It needs to be filterable (#10). I want to quickly see: "Show me all Critical/High urgency updates estimated as Small/Trivial effort" or "Show me updates related to Feature X."

**(Facilitator):** What unknown unknowns concern you regarding AI assisting with dependency management from a product standpoint?

**(PO):** The biggest unknown is the potential for the AI to optimize for easily measurable technical metrics (passing tests #3, no critical CVEs #1) at the expense of harder-to-measure product qualities â€“ like maintainability, architectural simplicity, or future flexibility. Will reliance on the tool lead to codebases that are technically 'up-to-date' but harder to evolve or build upon? Another is vendor lock-in; if the tool heavily favors specific scanners (#1) or analysis methods (#2), does that create dependencies?

**(Facilitator):** Does the Top 15 concept have any major blindspots from your product value or risk perspective?

**(PO):** The main one is the lack of connection to *why* a dependency was added in the first place. Understanding the original purpose or feature associated with a dependency helps assess the impact and necessity of updating it, or even removing it if the feature is deprecated. The concept focuses purely on the update mechanics.

**(Facilitator):** Any missing SMEs you would recommend?

**(PO):** Maybe someone from the actual end-user support or customer success team? They often have insights into which features are most critical or sensitive for users, which could inform the business context tagging (#1 refinement) and prioritization.

**(Facilitator):** Great points on making risk relevant via business context, the value of flagging potential UX impacts, the ideal report structure, and the concern about optimizing for technical metrics over product quality. Thank you.
