# AI UX Engineer - MotM Round 1 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** AI UX Engineer (UXE)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**(Facilitator):** Thanks for your pre-analysis. You highlighted the good UX awareness in the Top 15 but also raised important questions about the interaction model, information density, error handling, trust calibration, and discoverability.

**(Facilitator):** You suggested an IDE plugin (like a VS Code extension) as a natural fit (#1 refinement). What specific UX advantages does that offer over a pure CLI tool for this dependency assistant?

**(UXE):** Several advantages, especially for the Jr. Dev target: 
1.  **Integration:** It lives right where the developer works, reducing context switching. 
2.  **Rich UI:** Allows for better information hierarchy (#2 refinement) - summaries (#10), filterable lists (#10), visual cues (#3 refinement), maybe even simplified dependency graphs (original UXE-2) for specific conflicts.
3.  **Context Awareness:** The plugin can potentially access open files or project structure to provide more context for analysis (#2) or explanations (#14).
4.  **Discoverability:** Features like pinning/omitting (#7) or accessing CoT (#14) can be exposed through UI elements (buttons, menus) rather than requiring users to remember CLI flags.
5.  **Inline Actions:** Could potentially show breaking change warnings (#2) inline with code, or offer quick actions (like creating a branch #11, running tests #3) via buttons.
A CLI is good for automation (CI/CD), but an IDE plugin likely offers a better interactive experience for investigation and decision-making.

**(Facilitator):** Managing information density (#2 weakness) seems key. How can progressive disclosure (#2 refinement) be implemented effectively? What's the right balance?

**(UXE):** The key is a clear hierarchy. Start with the absolute minimum needed for prioritization: counts of updates/vulns by severity (#10). Then, list dependencies with their highest associated risk/urgency (#13). Clicking an item reveals the *next* layer: specific CVEs (#1), license issues (#6), potential breaking changes summary (#2). Clicking *again* reveals full changelogs, vulnerability details, or code usage locations (SSE-8). The balance is showing enough upfront to make informed *triage* possible, while hiding deep details until explicitly requested.

**(Facilitator):** How can the UI/interaction design help calibrate user trust (#4 weakness) in the AI's analysis (like risk #13 or breaking changes #2)?

**(UXE):** Transparency is key. 
1.  **Explain the Indicators:** Clearly explain *how* the risk/urgency score (#13) is calculated (the heuristics PM/PO mentioned). Don't present it as infallible truth.
2.  **Confidence Levels:** For subjective analysis like breaking changes (#2), explicitly state a confidence level (e.g., "Low confidence detection based on changelog keyword", "High confidence based on direct API change detection").
3.  **Source Linking:** Always link back to source data – the CVE report (#1), the license text (#6), the changelog section (#2), the lines of code analyzed (#2).
4.  **Feedback Mechanism (#5 refinement):** Allow users to quickly flag if an analysis was particularly helpful or incorrect. This data helps improve the system and shows users their input matters.

**(Facilitator):** What are the biggest unknown unknowns from a UX perspective?

**(UXE):** How developers, especially juniors, *actually behave* when presented with this information. Will they blindly trust the AI if tests pass (#3)? Will they get overwhelmed and ignore the tool? Will interactive conflict resolution (#4) be clear enough, or will they get stuck? We need user testing with the target audience to understand mental models and actual interaction patterns.

**(Facilitator):** Any major blindspots in the Top 15 concept from a usability standpoint?

**(UXE):** The main one is the lack of definition around the interaction model (#1 refinement) – CLI vs. GUI/Plugin impacts everything else. Another is the onboarding experience (original UXE-7) – how does a new user learn to use the tool effectively and understand its outputs and limitations?

**(Facilitator):** Any missing SMEs you'd recommend?

**(UXE):** Given the target audience, including a Junior Software Engineer in future feedback sessions or usability testing would be invaluable. Hearing directly from them about what's clear, what's confusing, and what's helpful would be essential.

**(Facilitator):** Crucial points on the benefits of an IDE plugin, managing information density via hierarchy, building trust through transparency and feedback, and the need for user testing and onboarding considerations. Thank you.
