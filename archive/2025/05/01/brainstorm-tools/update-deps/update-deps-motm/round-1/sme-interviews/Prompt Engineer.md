# Prompt Engineer - MotM Round 1 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Prompt Engineer (PE)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**(Facilitator):** Thanks for your pre-analysis. You focused on how the prompt structure needs to manage complexity, handle AI instruction nuances, ensure reliable parsing, and maintain the target persona. Let's explore that.

**(Facilitator):** You mentioned the challenge of orchestrating all Top 15 steps via a single prompt (#1 refinement). If we adopt your suggestion of modular prompting, what are the inherent challenges in maintaining context and consistency across those modules or turns?

**(PE):** The main challenge is context propagation and avoiding drift. Each modular prompt (e.g., for conflict resolution #4, or breaking change explanation #2) needs the relevant prior context: the user's initial request, the results of previous scans (#1), the dependencies being considered, user overrides (#7), etc. If the LLM call for each module is independent, we need a robust way (likely handled by the orchestrator Arch mentioned) to inject the necessary context each time. There's also the risk the AI 'forgets' constraints or the overall goal across multiple turns if not explicitly reminded in each modular prompt.

**(Facilitator):** You also highlighted instructing the AI to balance competing goals (#2 refinement) â€“ like prioritizing security fixes vs. minimizing breaking changes. Do you anticipate friction here? How can prompts effectively guide this trade-off?

**(PE):** Yes, friction is likely if the prioritization isn't clear or configurable. A prompt could explicitly state the default priority (e.g., "Priority 1: Apply critical/high security updates (#1). Priority 2: Avoid breaking changes (#2). Priority 3: Update to latest stable versions...") but *must* allow user overrides (#7). The friction comes when the AI flags a breaking change (#2) in a critical security update (#1). The prompt needs to guide the AI to *present this conflict* clearly to the user (#4) rather than making an autonomous decision. It should explain the trade-off: "Applying security fix for CVE-XXXX requires LibA v2, which introduces these potential breaking changes [details]. Proceed?"

**(Facilitator):** If you were to design the core interaction flow from a prompt perspective, what would your ideal solution look like?

**(PE):** I envision a state machine orchestrated by a non-AI component (like Arch's CLI tool idea). The AI/prompting comes in at specific states:
1.  **Input/Configuration:** User provides input via structured args/prompt (#7, #9 confirmation). AI *not* heavily involved here.
2.  **Initial Analysis & Summary:** Orchestrator runs scans (#1, #6, #12). *AI Prompt #1:* Takes scan results, project context. Generates clear summary (#10), risk/urgency indicators (#13), initial list for user filtering (#10).
3.  **Resolution/Planning:** Orchestrator runs resolver. If conflicts -> *AI Prompt #2:* Takes conflict data. Generates interactive resolution options (#4) explaining trade-offs.
4.  **Impact Analysis:** Once versions are selected -> *AI Prompt #3:* Takes selected versions, changelogs, maybe code snippets. Generates breaking change analysis/explanations (#2), potentially suggests code mods (SSE-1).
5.  **Execution Preview:** Orchestrator generates commands. *AI Prompt #4 (Optional):* Explain *why* these specific commands are being run. User confirms (#5).
6.  **Testing & Rollback:** Orchestrator runs tests (#3). If fails -> *AI Prompt #5:* Explain test failures, suggest rollback (#8) or debugging steps.
This uses AI for analysis and explanation, but relies on structured orchestration for flow control and tool execution.

**(Facilitator):** That makes sense. What unknown unknowns worry you most from a prompting perspective? Are there subtle ways the interaction could fail?

**(PE):** My main worry is the AI hallucinating or misinterpreting external data crucial for safety. For example, misreading a changelog (#2) and reporting no breaking changes when there are significant ones, or misinterpreting a vulnerability report (#1) and assigning the wrong risk (#13). Also, ensuring the AI consistently applies user overrides (#7) throughout a multi-step process without 'forgetting' them is an unknown challenge.

**(Facilitator):** Does the current concept have any major blindspots regarding the AI-human interaction or prompt design?

**(PE):** The main blindspot is the lack of an explicit feedback loop on the AI's *explanations* (#2, #4, #14). How do we know if the Jr. Dev actually *understood* the explanation? Without feedback, the AI can't learn to improve its communication style for this specific audience. Also, the initial prompt needs to effectively capture the user's *intent* (e.g., quick security patch vs. major feature update) to guide the AI's strategy.

**(Facilitator):** Any missing SMEs you'd recommend for future rounds based on this?

**(PE):** Maybe someone specifically focused on Developer Education or Technical Writing? Given the goal of supporting junior developers and the importance of clear explanations (#2, #4, #14), having someone who specializes in crafting clear technical communication could be very valuable for refining those specific AI prompts and outputs.

**(Facilitator):** Very insightful. The modular prompting idea, the state machine concept, the focus on clear conflict presentation, and the concerns about hallucination and the feedback loop are all crucial points. Thank you.
