# Product Owner - MotM Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Assets, Strategies, Methodologies, Workflows for V1 CLI (Product Value & User Perspective)

Evaluating the V1 CLI concept based on product value, user needs, and prioritization:

**1. Assets:**

*   **User Personas (Refined):** Refine the target user personas (e.g., Junior Developer, Mid-Level Developer on Ops Rotation) including their goals, pain points related to dependency updates, and technical proficiency.
*   **V1 Feature List & Prioritization:** A clear, prioritized list of features for the V1 CLI, derived directly from the R1 refined concept (Section 4 of analysis doc). This becomes the V1 backlog.
*   **Business Context Configuration Guide:** Simple documentation explaining *how* and *why* users should set up the business context mapping (PO Ref #1 from R1) in the `config.yaml` file.
*   **Risk/Urgency Score Definition:** Document the initial V1 formula or heuristics used to calculate the risk score (#13), making it clear which factors are included (CVE severity, license risk, potential business context tags).
*   **Effort Bucket Definitions:** Define the criteria for the initial 'Trivial', 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large' effort indicators (PO/PM Ref #3), acknowledging they are rough heuristics.

**2. Strategies:**

*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Strategy:** Define the absolute minimum feature set from the V1 concept required to deliver initial value and allow for user feedback. Focus on the core workflow: Scan -> Analyze (Vuln/License) -> Report -> Branch -> Update -> Test -> Report.
*   **Feedback Collection Strategy:** Plan how to collect early feedback on the V1 CLI (e.g., internal pilot program, targeted user interviews, feedback command within the CLI).
*   **Value Proposition Communication Strategy:** Clearly articulate the primary benefits of the V1 tool for developers (e.g., saves time scanning, highlights critical risks, standardizes update process) in documentation and onboarding materials.
*   **Phased Rollout Strategy (Internal):** If applicable, plan a phased rollout to internal teams, starting with early adopters, to gather feedback before wider release.

**3. Methodologies:**

*   **User Story Mapping:** Use user story mapping to break down the V1 features into smaller, implementable user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
*   **Usability Testing (Post-MVP):** Plan for usability testing sessions (leveraging UXE expertise) with target developers using early versions of the CLI to validate workflows and identify pain points.
*   **Value-Based Prioritization:** Continuously prioritize backlog items based on estimated user value, development effort, and alignment with product goals.

**4. Workflows:**

*   **User Onboarding Workflow (V1 CLI):**
    1.  User installs CLI.
    2.  User runs `depup init` (hypothetical) to generate a sample `config.yaml`.
    3.  User reads README to understand configuration (test command, etc.).
    4.  User (optionally) reads guide to configure business context mapping.
    5.  User runs `depup scan` to get initial analysis.
*   **Prioritization Workflow (Product):**
    1.  Gather feedback from users/stakeholders.
    2.  Review backlog of potential features/improvements (including R1 deferred items).
    3.  Estimate value/effort for each item.
    4.  Prioritize items for the next development cycle based on strategy (e.g., focus on core workflow stability, add next critical security check, improve usability).
