# Senior Software Engineer - MotM Round 2 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Senior Software Engineer (SSE)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator
**Input:** `/Users/wknowles/Develop/ai/wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/update-deps/update-deps-motm/round-2/pre-analysis/Senior Software Engineer.md`

**(Facilitator):** SSE, your pre-analysis focused clearly on the practical developer experience: documentation, configuration, and managing expectations around AI analysis. Let's explore a couple of areas.

**(Facilitator):** You emphasized the Breaking Change Communication Strategy (Strategy #1) â€“ positioning AI analysis (#2) as a heuristic. Besides cautious language, how else can the tool concretely help a developer investigate a *potential* breaking change flagged by the AI?

**(SSE):** Beyond just flagging it, the tool should provide direct links and context. V1 should aim to:
1.  **Link to Changelog:** Provide a direct link to the specific version's changelog section, if identifiable.
2.  **Link to Code Usage:** As I mentioned in R1, critically, link to the specific lines in *our codebase* where the potentially affected function/method/class from the dependency is used. This requires the orchestrator to have some basic code scanning capability or integration with static analysis results.
3.  **Show Evidence:** Briefly state *why* the AI flagged it (e.g., "Detected function removal `X` in changelog", "Detected changed parameters for `Y` used on line Z").
4.  **Suggest Next Steps:** Explicitly suggest actions like "Review linked code usage", "Check library documentation for migration guide", "Consider adding specific tests for this functionality".
This makes the flag actionable rather than just a vague warning.

**(Facilitator):** Your Configuration Simplicity Strategy (Strategy #3) mentions sensible defaults. What are the absolute *minimum* configurations a user MUST provide for V1 to function, versus what could be defaulted or auto-detected?

**(SSE):** Minimum required config for V1:
*   **Test Command (#3):** Absolutely essential. The tool cannot reliably guess how to run the project's tests. This *must* be provided.
Optional, but highly recommended / good defaults needed:
*   **Package Manager:** Could likely auto-detect common ones (npm, pip, yarn) based on lockfiles (#15) or project files.
*   **License Policy (#6):** Could default to common permissive policies (e.g., allow MIT, Apache, BSD) but needs to be configurable for stricter org requirements.
*   **Vulnerability Sources (#1):** Could default to a common public source API, but needs config for private feeds or specific tool paths/keys.
*   **Tool Paths:** Default to assuming tools (git, package manager) are in the system PATH.
Everything else (risk thresholds, business context, etc.) should be optional with sensible defaults for V1 to lower the barrier to entry.

**(Facilitator):** You proposed a Developer Feedback Loop (Methodology #1). What kind of feedback would be most valuable for improving V1 from your perspective as a developer user?

**(SSE):** Most valuable feedback:
1.  **Accuracy of Analysis:** Was the breaking change analysis (#2) helpful? Did it flag real issues? Did it miss things? Was the risk score (#13) reasonable?
2.  **Clarity of Output:** Was the information presented clearly? Was it easy to understand what needed attention? Were the explanations (#14) useful?
3.  **Workflow Friction:** Were there annoying steps? Was configuration difficult? Did the tool feel slow?
4.  **Test Integration (#3):** Did it correctly find and run the tests? Was failure reporting useful?
5.  **Bugs/Errors:** Any crashes, unexpected behavior, or incorrect commands (#5)?
Focus on the core value proposition: Does it save time and help me update dependencies safely and correctly?

**(Facilitator):** From a developer perspective, what's the biggest potential point of friction or annoyance in the proposed V1 workflow?

**(SSE):** The biggest friction point is likely **false positives** from the breaking change analysis (#2). If the tool constantly flags minor or irrelevant changes as potential breaks, developers will quickly learn to ignore the warnings, defeating the purpose. It's crucial that the AI analysis is tuned (via PE prompts and evaluation) to have reasonably high precision, even if it means lower recall (i.e., better to miss a few subtle breaks than to cry wolf constantly). The mandatory review for major versions helps mitigate the risk of missed breaks.

**(Facilitator):** Any remaining blindspots in the V1 plan after R1, from your practical viewpoint?

**(SSE):** We haven't explicitly discussed handling **pre/post-install scripts** in dependencies. These can execute arbitrary code and are a significant security risk (related to SE's R1 points) and potential source of update failures. While V1 might not *analyze* these scripts, the orchestrator should ideally be aware of their existence and potentially flag dependencies that use them for extra scrutiny. Also, the dependency resolution (#9) itself can sometimes have surprising results depending on the specific package manager; ensuring the tool uses the *exact same resolution mechanism* as the developer normally would is important.

**(Facilitator):** Any missing SMEs needed for V1 development?

**(SSE):** Re-emphasizing my R1 point and Arch/PE's points: developers with deep experience in the *specific target ecosystems* (e.g., Node, Python) are crucial. They understand the nuances of the package managers, common library patterns, and typical testing setups far better than generalists. Getting the `PackageManagerAdapter` and `TestRunnerAdapter` right depends heavily on this expertise.

**(Facilitator):** Great practical insights on making analysis actionable, minimizing config, crucial feedback areas, the pain of false positives, and install script awareness. Thank you.
