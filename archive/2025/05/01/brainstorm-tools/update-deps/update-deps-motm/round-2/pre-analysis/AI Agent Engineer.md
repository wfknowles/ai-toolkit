# AI Agent Engineer - MotM Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Assets, Strategies, Methodologies, Workflows for V1 CLI (AI Integration & Future Agentic Potential Perspective)

Looking at the V1 CLI from the perspective of integrating the AI components and enabling future, more agentic capabilities:

**1. Assets:**

*   **LLM API Client Library:** A well-defined internal library handling communication with the chosen LLM(s), managing API keys, timeouts, basic retries, and potentially abstracting differences between models.
*   **Context Builder Module:** Code responsible for gathering and formatting the specific context required by each modular prompt (PE Asset #1), based on the orchestrator's state and tool outputs.
*   **Output Parser Module:** Code responsible for parsing the LLM responses, especially extracting structured data based on PE's defined schemas (PE Asset #3) or using regex/heuristics for less structured output.
*   **Tool Schema Definitions (Input for AI):** While adapters (Arch Asset #1) wrap tool execution, we may need schemas defining the *outputs* of these tools in a format the AI can easily understand when passed in context (e.g., JSON representation of scan results).
*   **Evaluation Dataset for AI Tasks:** Specific datasets to evaluate the AI's performance on key V1 tasks: vulnerability summarization, breaking change identification (against a ground truth baseline), conflict explanation clarity.

**2. Strategies:**

*   **AI Integration Strategy (V1):** AI is purely analytical. It receives context from the orchestrator, performs analysis/generation based on PE prompts, and returns results. No direct tool control or autonomous action.
*   **Context Management Strategy (for AI):** Focus on providing only the necessary context for each specific AI task to minimize token usage and reduce hallucination risk. Avoid passing unnecessary history or overly broad project information.
*   **Failure Handling Strategy (AI):** Define how the orchestrator handles LLM API failures (timeouts, errors) or low-confidence AI responses. Should it proceed without AI analysis, report failure, or retry?
*   **Observability Strategy (AI):** Implement logging for all LLM interactions: prompts sent, responses received, latency, token usage. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Future Agentic Design Strategy:** Design the Orchestrator (Arch Asset #1) and LLM Interaction Module (AIE Asset #1) interfaces anticipating future needs, such as: allowing the AI to *request* specific tool runs (information gathering) or suggest multi-step plans, even if not implemented in V1.

**3. Methodologies:**

*   **LLM Task Evaluation Methodology:** Regularly evaluate the quality of AI outputs (summaries, explanations) using the evaluation dataset (AIE Asset #5) and human review (potentially involving SSE/UXE). Track accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness metrics.
*   **Prompt Tuning/Refinement Process:** Establish a process for iteratively improving PE's prompt templates based on evaluation results and user feedback.
*   **Token Usage Monitoring:** Track token consumption per AI call to manage costs and stay within context window limits.

**4. Workflows:**

*   **AI Analysis Workflow (Generic):**
    1.  Orchestrator determines need for AI analysis (e.g., summarize scans, check breaking changes).
    2.  Context Builder Module gathers relevant data (scan results, changelogs, code snippets, user config).
    3.  Orchestrator selects appropriate PE Prompt Template.
    4.  Context Builder formats data and injects into template.
    5.  LLM API Client sends prompt to LLM.
    6.  LLM API Client receives response.
    7.  Output Parser Module extracts information/text from response.
    8.  Orchestrator uses parsed data/text for reporting or decision support.
*   **Potential Future Workflow (Info Gathering - Deferred):**
    1.  AI analysis identifies an unknown (e.g., unclear error message).
    2.  AI response indicates need for more info and suggests a query/tool use.
    3.  Orchestrator (if enabled) parses request, executes tool (e.g., web search adapter), returns results to AI.
    4.  AI incorporates new info into analysis.
