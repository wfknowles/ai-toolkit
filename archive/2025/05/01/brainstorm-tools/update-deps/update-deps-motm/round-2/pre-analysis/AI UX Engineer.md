# AI UX Engineer - MotM Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Assets, Strategies, Methodologies, Workflows for V1 CLI (User Experience & Interaction Design Perspective)

Focusing on the user experience of the V1 CLI tool, particularly for the target Jr. Dev audience:

**1. Assets:**

*   **CLI Command Design Document:** Define the specific CLI commands (`scan`, `update`, `init`, `config`, potentially `help`), their arguments, flags, and expected behavior.
*   **Output Formatting Guidelines:** Define standards for console output: use of color, spacing, indentation, visual cues (e.g., icons/emojis for risk levels), and structure for clarity and scannability.
*   **Wording & Tone Guide:** Guidelines for the language used in CLI output and AI explanations (#14) â€“ should be clear, concise, encouraging, avoid jargon where possible, align with PE's persona definition.
*   **Progress Indicator Designs:** Define how progress is shown for long-running tasks (e.g., simple spinners, progress bars if possible).
*   **Error Message Library:** Design clear, helpful error messages for common failure scenarios (e.g., config file not found, invalid API key, tool not found, test command failed).
*   **Usability Testing Plan (Post-MVP):** Outline the plan for conducting usability tests: target users, tasks to perform (e.g., configure tool, run scan, interpret results, perform an update), metrics to collect (task success, time on task, qualitative feedback).

**2. Strategies:**

*   **Progressive Disclosure Strategy (CLI):** Define how information is presented in layers. Default `scan`/`update` shows summary (#10); flags like `--verbose` or specific subcommands reveal details (CVE details, full changelogs, test logs).
*   **Clarity over Completeness Strategy:** Prioritize making the *most important* information (critical vulns, likely breaking changes, test failures) easily understandable, even if it means omitting some lower-priority details in the default view.
*   **Actionability Strategy:** Ensure that outputs requiring user action (e.g., conflict resolution prompts, confirmation prompts #5, rollback instructions #8) are clearly identifiable and provide obvious next steps.
*   **Trust Calibration Strategy (UX):** Use UI/output design to reinforce trust calibration: clearly label AI-generated analysis (#2, #13), use cautious wording, provide links to source data (SSE point), potentially include a feedback mechanism (PO strategy #2).
*   **Consistency Strategy:** Ensure consistency in command structure, argument names, output formatting, and terminology across the entire CLI tool.

**3. Methodologies:**

*   **Heuristic Evaluation:** Evaluate early designs/prototypes of the CLI output against usability heuristics (e.g., Nielsen's heuristics).
*   **Cognitive Walkthrough:** Step through the primary user workflows (SSE workflow #1) from the perspective of a target user (PO persona #1) to identify potential points of confusion.
*   **A/B Testing (If Applicable):** Potentially A/B test different output formats or wording choices if there's significant uncertainty.

**4. Workflows:**

*   **CLI Help Workflow:**
    1.  User runs `depup --help` or `depup [command] --help`.
    2.  CLI displays well-formatted help text detailing commands, arguments, and options.
*   **Error Handling Workflow (User Perspective):**
    1.  Tool encounters an error (e.g., invalid config, tool failure).
    2.  CLI displays a clear error message (from Error Message Library) explaining what went wrong and suggesting next steps (e.g., "Error: Test command failed. Check logs at [path] or run tests manually. Use `depup rollback` to revert changes.").
*   **Progressive Disclosure Workflow (Example: Scan Output):**
    1.  User runs `depup scan`.
    2.  Output shows: Summary counts (X Critical Vulns, Y High Vulns, Z License issues), list of packages with highest risk update available.
    3.  User runs `depup scan --verbose` or `depup scan --package=libX`.
    4.  Output shows detailed CVE info, license details, full version list, etc., for the specified scope.
