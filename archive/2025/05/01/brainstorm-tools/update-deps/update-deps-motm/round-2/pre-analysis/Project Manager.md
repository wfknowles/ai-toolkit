# Project Manager - MotM Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Assets, Strategies, Methodologies, Workflows for V1 CLI (Project Planning & Execution Perspective)

Considering the V1 CLI project from a planning, tracking, and execution standpoint:

**1. Assets:**

*   **Project Plan/Roadmap (V1):** High-level plan outlining phases (e.g., Core Orchestrator Dev, Tool Adapter Dev, AI Integration, Testing, Pilot) and estimated timelines for V1 delivery.
*   **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Detailed breakdown of the V1 features (from PO Asset #2) into specific development tasks assignable to team members.
*   **Team Composition & Roles:** Define the core team members needed for V1 development and their primary responsibilities (e.g., Backend Dev, Security Specialist, AI/Prompt Engineer, QA).
*   **Risk Register:** Document potential project risks (technical, resource, schedule) and mitigation strategies (e.g., Risk: Tool Adapter complexity; Mitigation: Allocate extra time for testing adapters).
*   **Communication Plan:** Define how the project team will communicate (meetings, chat channels, status reports) and how progress will be reported to stakeholders.
*   **Markdown Task Output Template:** Define the specific format for the Markdown output (PM Ref #2) intended for manual import into PM tools, ensuring it includes key info (Update details, Risk #13, Effort #3, Branch name #11).

**2. Strategies:**

*   **Development Methodology Strategy:** Choose and define the development methodology (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) for the V1 project, including sprint length/cycle time, ceremonies, and artifact management.
*   **Task Tracking Strategy:** Select and configure a tool (e.g., Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects) for tracking tasks from the WBS, assigning owners, and monitoring progress.
*   **Quality Assurance Strategy:** Define the QA approach, including types of testing (unit, integration, E2E - Arch/SSE methods), responsibilities (developer vs. dedicated QA), and bug tracking process.
*   **Release Strategy (V1):** Define the criteria for the V1 release (e.g., completion of MVP features, successful pilot testing, documentation readiness) and the release process itself.
*   **Stakeholder Management Strategy:** Identify key stakeholders (e.g., Development teams, Security team, Product leadership) and plan how to keep them informed and involved.

**3. Methodologies:**

*   **Agile Estimation Techniques:** Use techniques like story points or t-shirt sizing to estimate effort for tasks in the WBS.
*   **Regular Status Reporting:** Implement a regular cadence for reporting project status (progress, risks, issues) to stakeholders.
*   **Change Management Process:** Define a simple process for handling scope changes or significant requirement updates during V1 development.

**4. Workflows:**

*   **Development Sprint Workflow (Example - Scrum):**
    1.  Sprint Planning: Select tasks from backlog based on priority and capacity.
    2.  Daily Standups: Team syncs on progress and blockers.
    3.  Development & Testing: Implement features, write tests, conduct code reviews.
    4.  Sprint Review: Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders.
    5.  Sprint Retrospective: Team discusses what went well/poorly and identifies improvements.
*   **Bug Triage Workflow:**
    1.  Bug reported (via feedback channel or QA).
    2.  Bug logged in tracking tool.
    3.  PM/Lead assesses severity and priority.
    4.  Assign bug to developer for investigation/fixing.
    5.  Fix verified by QA.
*   **Manual PM Tool Integration Workflow (User):**
    1.  User runs `depup update` and gets Markdown output.
    2.  User copies relevant sections from Markdown.
    3.  User manually creates/updates ticket in Jira/etc., pasting information.
