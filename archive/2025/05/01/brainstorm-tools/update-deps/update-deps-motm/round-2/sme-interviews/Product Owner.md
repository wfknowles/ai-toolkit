# Product Owner - MotM Round 2 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Product Owner (PO)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator
**Input:** `/Users/wknowles/Develop/ai/wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/update-deps/update-deps-motm/round-2/pre-analysis/Product Owner.md`

**(Facilitator):** Your focus on the MVP, user feedback, and clear value proposition is crucial for launching a successful V1. Let's refine the product definition.

**(Facilitator):** You proposed an MVP strategy (Strategy #1) focusing on the core Scan -> Analyze -> Report -> Branch -> Update -> Test -> Report flow. Which specific features from the R1 refined concept *must* be in that initial MVP versus being fast-follows?

**(PO):** For the absolute MVP to test the core loop and get feedback:
*   **Must-Haves:**
    *   Basic CLI structure & config loading (Arch/SSE Asset #1).
    *   Core `scan` command: Vuln (#1) & License (#6) checks via adapters.
    *   Core `update` command: Branching (#11), Package Manager update (#15), Test runner (#3).
    *   Basic console reporting: Summary (#10), test pass/fail, rollback command (#8).
    *   Mandatory test command configuration (SSE point).
    *   Mandatory command preview/confirmation (#5).
*   **Fast-Follows (Crucial but maybe not Day 1):**
    *   AI Analysis: Breaking changes (#2), Risk score (#13), Summaries (#10), Explanations (#14). (Could launch MVP with just tool outputs, per PA's decoupling strategy).
    *   Conflict Resolution Aid (#4).
    *   Transitive dependency scanning (#12 - if initial scanner doesn't cover it).
    *   Integrity/Dependency Confusion checks (SE points).
    *   User Overrides (#7).
    *   Business context / Effort indicators.
The MVP proves the orchestration works; the AI layer adds the intelligence we evaluate next.

**(Facilitator):** Regarding the Risk/Urgency Score (#13) and Effort Buckets (#3 R1 Refinement) - you defined these as assets. How important is it to have *some* version of these, even if very heuristic, in the initial user-facing releases (maybe post-MVP fast-follow)?

**(PO):** I think having *initial, clearly labeled heuristic* versions of both is important soon after the basic orchestration MVP. Without any risk scoring (#13), users get a flat list of updates, making prioritization hard. Even a simple score based just on CVE severity and maybe major version bumps helps guide attention. Similarly, a very basic effort bucket (e.g., based on version change type: Patch=Trivial, Minor=Small, Major=Large) helps users mentally budget time (PM point). We just need to manage expectations (SSE/PE point) that these are *rough guides*, not precise measures, and document how they're calculated (Asset #4, #5).

**(Facilitator):** Your Feedback Collection Strategy (Strategy #2) mentions internal pilots and interviews. What specific questions are most important to ask early users of the V1 (or MVP) CLI?

**(PO):** Key questions for early feedback:
1.  **Core Value:** Did this tool save you time compared to your previous update process? How?
2.  **Ease of Use:** Was it easy to install, configure, and run? Was the output understandable? (Ties to UXE points)
3.  **Trust & Accuracy:** Did you trust the information provided (scan results, test results)? If AI analysis is included: Did the breaking change warnings seem accurate? Were the risk scores helpful?
4.  **Workflow Fit:** Did it integrate reasonably well with your workflow (branching, testing)?
5.  **Pain Points:** What was the most frustrating or confusing part of using the tool?
6.  **Missing Pieces:** What's the single most important thing missing for it to be more useful?

**(Facilitator):** How do you balance the desire for more features (like the deferred list in R1) with the need to keep V1 focused and deliver value quickly?

**(PO):** Ruthless prioritization based on the MVP strategy and core value prop. For V1, we focus *only* on features that directly support the primary goal: helping developers safely and efficiently update dependencies by automating scanning, testing, and providing basic analysis. Anything else (advanced heuristics, deep integrations, complex AI features) gets pushed to the backlog. We need to prove the core loop is valuable and reliable first (Methodology #3). We resist scope creep by constantly asking, "Is this essential for the *initial* defined value prop?"

**(Facilitator):** Any product-related unknown unknowns for V1?

**(PO):** The biggest is actual user adoption and behavior change. Will developers *use* the tool regularly? Will they trust it enough to change their habits? Will the perceived benefits outweigh the initial learning curve and configuration effort? We can build what we *think* is valuable, but actual usage patterns are hard to predict perfectly (ties to UXE R1 unknown).

**(Facilitator):** Any blindspots remaining from a product value perspective?

**(PO):** Perhaps the initial focus on individual developer workflow might underemphasize the *team-level* benefits. While V1 targets the dev, the aggregated data (if collected later via metrics - PA Asset #5) or consistent use across a team could provide valuable insights for tech leads or managers about overall project health, which isn't explicitly captured in the V1 value prop.

**(Facilitator):** Missing SMEs?

**(PO):** For V1 definition, this group feels right. As we get closer to release and think about rollout (Strategy #4), involving some **Tech Leads** or **Engineering Managers** from potential user teams would be good to understand team-level adoption challenges and integration points.

**(Facilitator):** Great clarification on the MVP scope, the pragmatic approach to initial heuristics, key feedback questions, and prioritization strategy. Thank you.
