# Principal Architect - MotM Round 2 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Principal Architect (PA)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator

**(Facilitator):** Your focus on the broader architecture, integration, and future evolution is much needed. Let's explore some of your points for V1.

**(Facilitator):** You mentioned defining the Technology Stack (Asset #1). What factors should drive the choice of language/runtime (Python, Go, Rust, etc.) for this V1 CLI tool?

**(PA):** Key factors are:
1.  **Ecosystem Integration:** How easily can the language interact with the target package managers and build tools (e.g., invoking subprocesses, parsing outputs)? Python and Go are often strong here.
2.  **Team Expertise:** What languages does the development team already know well? Leveraging existing skills accelerates development.
3.  **CLI Framework Maturity:** Availability of robust libraries for CLI parsing, configuration handling, etc. (e.g., Typer/Click for Python, Cobra for Go).
4.  **Performance:** While less critical for V1 (Strategy #4), consider if future scalability might favor a compiled language like Go or Rust over an interpreted one like Python.
5.  **Security:** Availability of libraries for secure subprocess execution and potential for static analysis of the tool itself.
For V1, I'd lean towards Python or Go based on ecosystem interaction and framework maturity, depending on team expertise.

**(Facilitator):** You proposed a Decoupling Strategy (Strategy #2) between the orchestrator and AI. How strictly should this be enforced in V1? Should the tool be fully functional *without* any LLM interaction, just using basic tool outputs?

**(PA):** Yes, I believe that's the right approach for V1. The core workflow (scan, resolve, branch, update, test) should function using *only* the deterministic outputs of the wrapped tools (package manager, scanners, git, test runner). The LLM interaction module (AIE Asset #1) should be layered on top to provide the *enhanced analysis* (breaking changes #2, summaries #10, explanations #14). This means the CLI could have a `--no-ai` flag or similar. This decoupling provides resilience if the LLM API fails, allows use in restricted environments, and provides a clear baseline for evaluating the *added value* of the AI component.

**(Facilitator):** Your CI/CD Integration Workflow (Workflow #1) includes a `--ci` mode and JSON output. What specific information is essential in that JSON report for automated pipeline decisions?

**(PA):** The essential info for a CI `report.json` would be:
1.  **Scan Summary:** Counts of vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
2.  **License Compliance:** Overall status (Compliant/Non-compliant), list of non-compliant licenses found.
3.  **Dependency Confusion:** Flag if potential confusion issues were detected.
4.  **Tool Errors:** Indication if any underlying scanners failed to run.
This allows the pipeline to make go/no-go decisions based on configured policies (e.g., `fail build if critical_vulns > 0 OR license_status == 'Non-compliant'`). It should *not* include subjective AI analysis like breaking changes for CI purposes.

**(Facilitator):** You strongly recommended investigating sandboxing (Strategy #3) for tool execution, even if complex for V1. What's a pragmatic first step towards this in V1 versus a full containerized approach?

**(PA):** A pragmatic first step, short of full containerization per tool run (which adds overhead), is to focus on **least privilege execution**. Run the CLI tool itself, and any subprocesses it spawns, as a non-privileged user. Use operating system features where possible to restrict file system access for subprocesses (e.g., `chroot` Jails, user namespaces on Linux, though these add complexity). Ensure strict input sanitization for any data passed *to* the external tools via arguments. While not true sandboxing, it reduces the blast radius compared to running everything as the main user. Document full containerization as a high-priority item for V2 security hardening.

**(Facilitator):** Any system-level unknown unknowns that concern you?

**(PA):** The interaction between different package managers and complex project structures (monorepos with cross-dependencies, multi-stage builds) remains a significant unknown. How well will our adapters and core logic handle non-standard setups? Another is the potential performance impact on the developer's machine when running multiple scans and potentially AI analysis â€“ we need to ensure the tool isn't excessively resource-hungry (Methodology #3).

**(Facilitator):** Did Round 1 have any major architectural blindspots you observed?

**(PA):** Round 1 focused heavily on features, which was appropriate. The main blindspot, now addressed in R2 pre-analysis, was the lack of explicit discussion around non-functional requirements like security *of the tool*, scalability, maintainability, observability (metrics), and technology stack choices. Thinking about these early prevents costly refactoring later.

**(Facilitator):** Any missing SMEs you'd add from your perspective?

**(PA):** Echoing Arch, DevOps/SRE is crucial for operationalizing this, especially CI/CD integration and potential sandboxing strategies. Also, depending on the chosen tech stack, ensuring we have senior expertise *in that specific language* (Python, Go, etc.) on the core dev team is important for building a robust and maintainable tool.

**(Facilitator):** Excellent points on tech stack selection drivers, the importance of AI decoupling, essential CI output, pragmatic steps towards sandboxing, and considering non-functional requirements early. Thank you.
