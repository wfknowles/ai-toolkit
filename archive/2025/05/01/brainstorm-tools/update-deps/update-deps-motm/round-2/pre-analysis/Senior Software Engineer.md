# Senior Software Engineer - MotM Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Assets, Strategies, Methodologies, Workflows for V1 CLI (Developer Experience & Practicality Perspective)

Focusing on the practical implementation and developer usage of the V1 CLI tool:

**1. Assets:**

*   **Sample Project Configurations:** Create example `config.yaml` files for different project types (e.g., Node.js backend, Python library, React frontend) demonstrating configuration of test commands, tool paths, license policies.
*   **Clear Usage Documentation (README.md):** Comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, command usage (`scan`, `update`), interpreting output (especially risk scores #13 and breaking change warnings #2), and troubleshooting common issues.
*   **Contribution Guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md):** If open-sourcing or for internal teams, guidelines on how to add new Tool Adapters (Arch Asset #1) or improve documentation.
*   **Test Suite for Sample Projects:** Representative test suites for the sample projects used in E2E testing (Arch Method #2) to ensure the `TestRunnerAdapter` works correctly.

**2. Strategies:**

*   **Breaking Change Communication Strategy:** Emphasize in documentation and output (#14) that AI analysis (#2) is a *heuristic* flag, not definitive. Use cautious language ("Potential breaking change detected..."). Always recommend manual review for major updates.
*   **Test Failure Debugging Strategy:** Ensure the CLI output provides clear, actionable information when tests (#3) fail â€“ which tests failed, link to logs, the exact command run.
*   **Configuration Simplicity Strategy:** Keep the initial configuration (#1 Asset) as simple as possible. Provide sensible defaults. Allow overriding specific settings via CLI arguments for quick experiments.
*   **Performance Strategy (CLI):** Ensure the CLI tool itself is reasonably performant. Avoid unnecessary computations or slow external calls during non-essential steps. Provide progress indicators for long-running operations (like scanning or testing).

**3. Methodologies:**

*   **Developer Feedback Loop:** Establish a channel (e.g., GitHub Issues, internal chat) for developers using the tool to report bugs, suggest improvements, and share feedback on the usefulness and clarity of the AI analysis and output.
*   **Automated Testing for CLI:** Implement unit and integration tests for the CLI commands themselves (argument parsing, configuration loading, basic flow logic) independent of the full E2E tests.
*   **Code Review Standards:** Enforce code reviews focusing on clarity, maintainability, security (esp. around command execution #5), and adherence to architectural principles (modularity).

**4. Workflows:**

*   **Typical Developer Workflow (`update`):**
    1.  Developer runs `depup scan` periodically or as needed.
    2.  Reviews summary (#10), filters list.
    3.  Runs `depup update [--package=libX]` for desired updates.
    4.  Reviews AI analysis (#2), potential conflicts (#4).
    5.  Confirms execution (#5).
    6.  Tool creates branch (#11), installs updates (#15), runs tests (#3).
    7.  Developer reviews test results.
    8.  If tests pass, developer manually inspects code changes / AI warnings (#2), potentially adds more tests, then creates PR.
    9.  If tests fail, developer uses provided logs and rollback command (#8) to investigate/revert.
*   **Configuration Workflow:**
    1.  Developer copies sample config to project root.
    2.  Edits config to specify project's test command, license policy, etc.
    3.  Commits config file to project repository.
