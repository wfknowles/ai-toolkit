# Principal Architect - MotM Round 2 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Assets, Strategies, Methodologies, Workflows for V1 CLI (System Integration, Scalability, Future-proofing Perspective)

Looking at the V1 CLI concept from a higher-level architectural perspective, considering integration and long-term evolution:

**1. Assets:**

*   **Technology Stack Definition:** Explicitly define the language/runtime (e.g., Python, Go, Rust) for the CLI tool and key dependencies.
*   **API Contract for LLM Interaction:** Formal definition of the request/response structure between the Orchestrator and the LLM API, including versioning.
*   **Tool Adapter Extensibility Design:** Document the design pattern for adding new `ToolAdapter` implementations (Arch Asset #1) to support different ecosystems or tools in the future.
*   **CI/CD Integration Pipeline Example:** A reference pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow, Jenkinsfile) demonstrating how to install the CLI tool and run the `scan` command automatically within a CI environment.
*   **Metrics Definition:** Define key operational metrics to track for the tool's usage and performance (e.g., number of scans, updates attempted/successful/failed, tool execution time, LLM call latency).

**2. Strategies:**

*   **Ecosystem Agnosticism Strategy:** While V1 might initially target specific ecosystems (via PackageManagerAdapter), design the core orchestrator logic to be as independent as possible from specific language/package manager details.
*   **Decoupling Strategy (Orchestrator <-> AI):** Ensure the orchestrator can function even if the LLM API is unavailable (e.g., skip AI analysis steps, rely solely on deterministic tool outputs), albeit with reduced functionality. The LLM interaction should be a distinct, potentially optional, module.
*   **Security Strategy (Tool Execution):** Reiterate SE/CISO points: Mandate secure subprocess execution patterns. Strongly recommend investigating sandboxing (e.g., Docker containers) for running external tools, even if complex for V1, as a critical future enhancement.
*   **Scalability Strategy (Initial):** V1 targets individual project runs. Avoid architectural decisions that would preclude future scaling to handle batch processing or larger monorepos (e.g., avoid reliance on global state). Design for efficient single-project analysis first.
*   **Future-Proofing Strategy (IDE Integration):** While V1 is CLI, design the core orchestration logic and Tool Adapters such that they *could* potentially be reused or exposed as a library for a future IDE plugin (UXE point).

**3. Methodologies:**

*   **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):** Use ADRs to document key architectural choices (e.g., language choice, state management strategy, tool invocation method) and their rationale.
*   **Threat Modeling Methodology:** Conduct a threat modeling exercise specifically on the CLI tool and its interaction points (user input, config files, external tools, network APIs) to identify potential security vulnerabilities (builds on SE/CISO points).
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Establish benchmarks for key workflows (scan, update) on representative projects to track performance over time and identify regressions.

**4. Workflows:**

*   **CI/CD Integration Workflow (`scan`):**
    1.  CI pipeline triggers (e.g., on schedule, on commit to main).
    2.  Pipeline checks out code.
    3.  Installs the `depup` CLI tool.
    4.  Runs `depup scan --ci --output=report.json` (hypothetical CI mode).
    5.  Parses `report.json` to check for critical issues (e.g., fail build if critical CVEs found).
    6.  Uploads `report.json` as build artifact.
*   **New Tool Adapter Integration Workflow:**
    1.  Developer implements new `ToolAdapter` interface.
    2.  Adds unit/integration tests for the adapter.
    3.  Updates orchestrator logic to call the new adapter at the appropriate workflow stage.
    4.  Updates configuration schema if needed.
    5.  Updates documentation.
