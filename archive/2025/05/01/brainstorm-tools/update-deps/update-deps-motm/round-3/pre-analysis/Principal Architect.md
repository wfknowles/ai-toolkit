# Principal Architect - MotM Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Initial Milestones, Phases, Steps for V1 CLI (Strategic Architecture & Long-term View)

Considering the V1 project plan with a focus on architectural integrity, scalability, and maintainability:

**Proposed Phases & Milestones (Strategic Architecture Focus):**

1.  **Phase 0: Architectural Definition & Decisions**
    *   **PA Milestone 0.1:** Finalize and document Technology Stack choice (Asset #1) via ADR (Methodology #1).
    *   **PA Milestone 0.2:** Document core architectural patterns (Modular CLI, Tool Adapters, Decoupled AI - Strategy #2) via ADRs.
    *   **PA Milestone 0.3:** Define and document Tool Adapter Interface (Arch Asset #3) and extensibility design (Asset #3).
    *   **PA Milestone 0.4:** Define and document API Contract for LLM Interaction (Asset #2).
    *   **PA Milestone 0.5:** Conduct initial Threat Modeling (Methodology #2) for the proposed V1 architecture.
2.  **Phase 1: Foundational Implementation** (Overlaps Arch/SSE Phase 1)
    *   *Dependency:* Phase 0 decisions made.
    *   **PA Milestone 1.1:** Review implementation of CLI Skeleton (Arch M1.2) for adherence to patterns.
    *   **PA Milestone 1.2:** Review implementation of Configuration Module (Arch M1.3) and State Management (Arch M1.4) for robustness and security.
3.  **Phase 2: Adapter & Core Logic Implementation** (Overlaps Arch/SSE Phase 2 & 3)
    *   *Dependency:* Interfaces defined in Phase 0.
    *   **PA Milestone 2.1:** Review key adapter implementations (`PackageManager`, `Git`, `TestRunner`) for adherence to interface, secure execution practices (Strategy #3), and error handling.
    *   **PA Milestone 2.2:** Review core orchestrator logic (non-AI workflow) for clarity, maintainability, and state transitions.
    *   **PA Milestone 2.3:** Define initial Performance Benchmarks (Methodology #3) and setup basic performance testing.
4.  **Phase 3: AI Integration & Decoupling Validation** (Overlaps Arch/SSE Phase 4)
    *   *Dependency:* Core non-AI workflow stable; AI Module interface defined.
    *   **PA Milestone 3.1:** Validate the Decoupling Strategy (Strategy #2) â€“ ensure `--no-ai` mode works and AI failures are handled gracefully.
    *   **PA Milestone 3.2:** Review LLM API contract implementation (Asset #2) and observability hooks (AIE Strategy #4).
5.  **Phase 4: CI/CD Integration & Hardening** (Overlaps Arch/SSE Phase 5)
    *   *Dependency:* Core features implemented.
    *   **PA Milestone 4.1:** Implement reference CI/CD pipeline example (Asset #4) demonstrating `scan --ci` usage.
    *   **PA Milestone 4.2:** Conduct final security review / threat model update before pilot/release.
    *   **PA Milestone 4.3:** Review final documentation for architectural accuracy.
    *   **PA Milestone 4.4:** Define initial Metrics collection strategy (Asset #5).

**Key Dependencies/Steps:**
*   Critical architectural decisions (Tech Stack, Interfaces, Core Patterns) need to be made and documented *upfront* (Phase 0) to guide implementation.
*   Focus on validating the non-AI core first (Phase 2/3) before integrating AI complexity (Phase 3/4), verifying the decoupling strategy.
*   Security (Threat Modeling, Secure Execution Review) should be integrated throughout the lifecycle, not just at the end.
*   Defining extensibility patterns early (Milestone 0.3) enables future growth (Strategy #5 - IDE Integration, more ecosystems).
*   CI/CD integration needs to be considered early, influencing design choices like the `--ci` mode and structured output.
