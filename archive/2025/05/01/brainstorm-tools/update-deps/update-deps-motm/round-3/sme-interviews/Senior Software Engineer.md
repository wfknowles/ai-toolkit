# Senior Software Engineer - MotM Round 3 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Senior Software Engineer (SSE)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator
**Input:** `/Users/wknowles/Develop/ai/wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/update-deps/update-deps-motm/round-3/pre-analysis/Senior Software Engineer.md`
**Context:** R1/R2 Analysis, R3 Pre-Planning Synthesis

**(Facilitator):** Your plan highlights the importance of sample projects (M1.1) and early, testable workflows (Phases 2 & 3). Let's talk about dependencies and potential developer friction.

**(Facilitator):** Your Phase 1 includes setting up sample projects. How complex is creating *representative* projects for testing adapters and workflows, especially covering diverse test setups or dependency structures?

**(SSE):** It requires conscious effort. We don't need massive projects, but:
1.  **Diversity:** We need samples for the target V1 ecosystem (e.g., npm & maybe yarn if Node; pip with `requirements.txt` & `pyproject.toml` if Python) reflecting common patterns.
2.  **Test Suite Variety:** Include projects with different test commands/runners (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, custom scripts) to validate the `TestRunnerAdapter` config (M1.2).
3.  **Dependency Scenarios:** Include cases like direct vs. transitive dependencies, potential conflicts (for later testing #4), maybe dependencies with known vulns or license issues.
It's not trivial, but doable. We can start simple and add complexity as needed. Having these *early* (M1.1) is crucial for adapter developers (Arch Phase 2) to test against.

**(Facilitator):** You propose validating the non-AI core workflow (Phase 3) before AI integration (Phase 4). What specific developer tasks or checks are essential during Phase 3 to sign off on that non-AI MVP candidate (Arch M3.4)?

**(SSE):** Key checks for the non-AI MVP sign-off:
1.  **Config Loading:** Does it correctly load and use the `testCommand`?
2.  **Scan Execution:** Does `scan` run the configured scanners/checkers and output their raw/basic results correctly?
3.  **Update Execution:** Does `update`:
    *   Correctly identify updates for the target ecosystem?
    *   Create a new branch (#11)?
    *   Run the correct package manager command to apply updates (#15)?
    *   Run the configured tests (#3) accurately?
    *   Report pass/fail status clearly?
    *   Provide correct rollback instructions (#8)?
4.  **Confirmation (#5):** Is the confirmation prompt clear and does it prevent action if declined?
Essentially, does the core mechanical loop work reliably and predictably as documented (M3.4)?

**(Facilitator):** You provide feedback on AI clarity/actionability in M4.3. What's the minimum level of actionability for AI breaking change warnings (#2) to be useful rather than just noise, especially given the V1 conservative approach?

**(SSE):** Minimum viable actionability for V1 AI warnings:
1.  **Identify the Package & Versions:** Clearly state `libX` updated from `v1.2` to `v2.0`.
2.  **State the *Reason* for Flagging:** E.g., "Major version bump suggests potential breaks." OR "Changelog mentions removal of function `Y`."
3.  **(Crucially) Link to Evidence:** Provide a link to the changelog if possible.
4.  **(Highly Desirable) Link to Code Usage:** If feasible for V1, link to where `libX` (or specifically function `Y`) is used in the user's code.
Even without deep semantic understanding, knowing *which* package, *why* it was flagged (even just semver), and *where* it's used gives the developer a concrete starting point for investigation. Anything less risks being ignored noise (R2 Interview point).

**(Facilitator):** The overall plan involves multiple phases and integrations. From a developer perspective, what's the biggest risk for delays or friction in this phased approach?

**(SSE):** The biggest friction risk is likely **misaligned dependencies between teams/phases**. For example, if the `PackageManagerAdapter` (Arch M2.3) doesn't parse output exactly as the AI Interaction Module expects (AIE M3.1/M3.2), or if the core workflow (Arch Phase 3) has bugs discovered only during AI integration (SSE Phase 4). This requires tight communication (PM Asset #5) and robust integration testing at each phase boundary.

**(Facilitator):** Let's revisit the security checks (integrity/confusion) that Arch preferred integrating earlier (Phase 3) while PO phased them later (Phase 4). From a developer workflow perspective, does integrating them earlier add significant burden or risk?

**(SSE):** Integrating them earlier (Phase 3) seems preferable from a workflow standpoint. They are deterministic checks tied closely to the package manager actions. Running `npm ci` (for integrity) or checking namespaces (for confusion) fits naturally alongside the core `update` mechanics. Deferring them feels artificial and means the "non-AI MVP" (Arch M3.4) is missing key safety features that should arguably be baseline. I agree with Arch; they should be part of the core, secure MVP build.

**(Facilitator):** Any previous decisions needing review? Any anti-patterns?
*   **Decision Review:** Confirming the prioritization of security checks (integrity/confusion) into the core MVP build phase.
*   **Anti-Pattern:** Writing documentation (SSE M1.3, M2.3, etc.) as an afterthought. It needs to be part of the Definition of Done for each feature/phase to be effective.

**(Facilitator):** Missing SMEs for planning?

**(SSE):** Still need the **Ecosystem Experts**. Their input is vital not just for adapter implementation but also for creating *realistic* sample projects (M1.1) and validating the tool's behavior against common practices in that ecosystem.

**(Facilitator):** Thanks, SSE. Practical points on representative sample projects, non-AI MVP checks, minimum actionable AI warnings, integration risks, and prioritizing security checks early. Very helpful.
