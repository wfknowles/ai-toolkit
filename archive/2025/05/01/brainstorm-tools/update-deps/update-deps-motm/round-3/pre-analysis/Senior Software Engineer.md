# Senior Software Engineer - MotM Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Initial Milestones, Phases, Steps for V1 CLI (Developer Workflow & Practical Build Perspective)

Phasing V1 development from a practical developer and testing standpoint:

**Proposed Phases & Milestones (Developer Workflow Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Utilities**
    *   *Dependency:* Arch/PA define tech stack, CLI skeleton, basic config.
    *   **SSE Milestone 1.1:** Setup sample projects (Asset #4) for the target V1 ecosystem(s) with representative dependencies and test suites.
    *   **SSE Milestone 1.2:** Implement basic `TestRunnerAdapter` (Arch M2.2) integration testing using sample projects.
    *   **SSE Milestone 1.3:** Develop initial `README.md` (Asset #2) covering installation and basic configuration (`testCommand`).
    *   **SSE Milestone 1.4:** Setup developer feedback channel (Methodology #1).
2.  **Phase 2: Basic `scan` Workflow**
    *   *Dependency:* Foundational CLI, config, core adapters (Vuln, License, PkgMgr - Arch Phase 2) are implemented.
    *   **SSE Milestone 2.1:** Basic `scan` command is runnable and produces deterministic output (scan results) for the target ecosystem.
    *   **SSE Milestone 2.2:** Test `scan` against sample projects; refine adapters based on parsing issues.
    *   **SSE Milestone 2.3:** Document `scan` command usage and output interpretation in README.
3.  **Phase 3: Basic `update` Workflow (No AI)**
    *   *Dependency:* Git adapter, PkgMgr adapter (update actions), TestRunner adapter are functional.
    *   **SSE Milestone 3.1:** `update` command successfully creates branch, applies updates (for target ecosystem), runs configured tests, reports pass/fail.
    *   **SSE Milestone 3.2:** Test `update` workflow (including rollback #8 instructions) against sample projects, covering success and test failure scenarios.
    *   **SSE Milestone 3.3:** Implement mandatory confirmation prompt (#5).
    *   **SSE Milestone 3.4:** Document `update` command usage, confirmation, and rollback in README.
4.  **Phase 4: AI Analysis Integration & Validation**
    *   *Dependency:* AI Interaction Module (AIE) is available; Core `scan`/`update` workflows are stable.
    *   **SSE Milestone 4.1:** `scan` command output includes AI summary (#10).
    *   **SSE Milestone 4.2:** `update` command output includes AI breaking change analysis (#2) (conservative version).
    *   **SSE Milestone 4.3:** Provide initial feedback to PE/AIE on the *clarity* and *actionability* of AI outputs based on sample project runs.
    *   **SSE Milestone 4.4:** Test the `--no-ai` flag (PA Strategy #2).
    *   **SSE Milestone 4.5:** Update README with info on interpreting AI analysis and its limitations.
5.  **Phase 5: Developer Experience Polish & Pilot Prep**
    *   *Dependency:* Core features and AI integration are functional.
    *   **SSE Milestone 5.1:** Refine CLI output formatting, error messages (UXE Assets), and progress indicators based on internal testing.
    *   **SSE Milestone 5.2:** Finalize configuration options and defaults (Strategy #3).
    *   **SSE Milestone 5.3:** Create comprehensive usage examples and finalize README.
    *   **SSE Milestone 5.4:** Prepare tool for internal pilot/dogfooding (PO Strategy #4).

**Key Dependencies/Steps:**
*   Need runnable sample projects *early* (Phase 1) to test adapters and workflows.
*   Documentation should be written *concurrently* with feature development, not left to the end.
*   Testing the non-AI core workflow (Phase 3) provides a crucial baseline before adding AI complexity.
*   Developer feedback on AI output usability (Milestone 4.3) is needed early in the AI integration phase.
*   Prioritizing minimal, essential configuration (Strategy #3) is key for initial adoption.
