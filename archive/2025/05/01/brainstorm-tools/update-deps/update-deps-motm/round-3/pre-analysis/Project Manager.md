# Project Manager - MotM Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Initial Milestones, Phases, Steps for V1 CLI (Project Execution & Management Perspective)

Mapping the V1 definition and other SME phase proposals onto a project management structure:

**Proposed Phases & Milestones (Project Management Focus):**

*   **Phase 0: Project Initiation & Planning**
    *   **PM Milestone 0.1:** Secure project resources (team - Asset #3, budget, tools).
    *   **PM Milestone 0.2:** Define & agree on Development Methodology (Strategy #1 - e.g., Scrum, 2-week sprints).
    *   **PM Milestone 0.3:** Set up Task Tracking tool (Strategy #2) and Communication channels (Asset #5).
    *   **PM Milestone 0.4:** Draft initial Project Plan/Roadmap (Asset #1) including high-level phase estimates.
    *   **PM Milestone 0.5:** Conduct initial Risk Assessment & create Risk Register (Asset #4).
    *   **PM Milestone 0.6:** Define QA Strategy (Strategy #3) and role responsibilities (dev vs. QA).
    *   *Dependency:* PO defines MVP scope (PO M1.1) & target ecosystem (PO M1.3); PA/Arch define tech stack (PA M0.1).

*   **Phase 1: Sprint 1-X (Foundation & Core Adapters)** (Maps to Arch/PA Phase 1 & 2, SSE Phase 1)
    *   **PM Milestone 1.1:** Foundational code (CLI skeleton, config, state) implemented and tested.
    *   **PM Milestone 1.2:** Core Tool Adapters (Git, TestRunner, Vuln, License, 1st PkgMgr) implemented and unit/integration tested.
    *   **PM Milestone 1.3:** Initial README and sample project setup complete.
    *   *Activities:* Task breakdown (WBS - Asset #2), Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Development, Testing, Code Reviews, Sprint Reviews/Retros.

*   **Phase 2: Sprint Y-Z (Core Workflow & MVP)** (Maps to Arch Phase 3, SSE Phase 2 & 3, PO Phase 2)
    *   **PM Milestone 2.1:** Non-AI `scan` workflow operational.
    *   **PM Milestone 2.2:** Non-AI `update` workflow operational (incl. branching, testing, confirm, rollback).
    *   **PM Milestone 2.3:** MVP Candidate (non-AI core loop) passes E2E tests and internal validation.
    *   *Activities:* Continued sprints, focus on workflow orchestration, E2E testing (Arch Method #2), internal dogfooding (PO M2.2).

*   **Phase 3: Sprint A-B (AI Integration & Fast-Follows)** (Maps to Arch Phase 4, SSE Phase 4, PO Phase 3 & 4)
    *   **PM Milestone 3.1:** AI Interaction Module integrated.
    *   **PM Milestone 3.2:** Prioritized AI analysis features integrated into `scan`/`update`.
    *   **PM Milestone 3.3:** Prioritized Security/Usability enhancements integrated.
    *   **PM Milestone 3.4:** AI features pass initial evaluation (AIE Method #1).
    *   *Activities:* Sprints focused on AI module integration, prompt testing/tuning, implementing security/usability stories based on PO priority.

*   **Phase 4: Sprint C-D (Stabilization, Documentation & Pilot)** (Maps to Arch Phase 5, SSE Phase 5, PO Phase 5)
    *   **PM Milestone 4.1:** CI integration (`scan --ci`) implemented and tested.
    *   **PM Milestone 4.2:** Final documentation, examples, and onboarding materials complete.
    *   **PM Milestone 4.3:** Performance benchmarks met (PA Method #3).
    *   **PM Milestone 4.4:** Successful internal Pilot Program completed; critical feedback addressed.
    *   **PM Milestone 4.5:** V1 Release Candidate approved.
    *   *Activities:* Bug fixing, documentation finalization, pilot execution & feedback analysis, release prep.

*   **Phase 5: Release & Post-Release** (Maps to PO Phase 6)
    *   **PM Milestone 5.1:** V1 Released.
    *   **PM Milestone 5.2:** Project Retrospective conducted.
    *   **PM Milestone 5.3:** Monitoring plan (PA Asset #5) activated.
    *   **PM Milestone 5.4:** Handover to maintenance/support or planning for V1.1 initiated.

**Key Dependencies/Steps:**
*   Clear MVP definition and ecosystem choice are needed before serious development starts (Phase 0 dependency).
*   Need realistic sprint planning acknowledging estimation uncertainty (Methodology #1, PM Interview).
*   Requires active management of inter-component dependencies during sprints.
*   Need buffer time for testing (unit, integration, E2E, QA) and potential AI tuning cycles.
*   Communication plan (Asset #5) needs to ensure smooth coordination between Arch, SSE, PE, AIE, QA, and PO.
