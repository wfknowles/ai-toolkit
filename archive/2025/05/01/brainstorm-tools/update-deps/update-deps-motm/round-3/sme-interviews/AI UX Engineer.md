# AI UX Engineer - MotM Round 3 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** AI UX Engineer (UXE)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator
**Input:** `/Users/wknowles/Develop/ai/wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/update-deps/update-deps-motm/round-3/pre-analysis/AI UX Engineer.md`
**Context:** R1/R2 Analysis, R3 Pre-Planning Synthesis, Prior R3 Interviews

**(Facilitator):** Your Phase 1 involves defining several key UX assets upfront (Command Design, Formatting, Wording, Progress, Errors - M1.1-1.3). How much detail is needed initially, and how do these feed into the early development sprints (PM Phase 1)?

**(UXE):** We need foundational guidelines, not exhaustive specs, in Phase 1. 
*   **Command Design (M1.1):** Basic structure of `scan` and `update`, key flags identified in R2 (e.g., `--interactive`, `--ci`).
*   **Formatting/Wording (M1.2):** Core principles â€“ use clear language, consistent terminology (e.g., always call it "breaking change analysis"), basic structure for summaries (e.g., bullet points), tone (informative, helpful).
*   **Progress/Errors (M1.3):** Basic patterns for showing activity (spinners?) and structuring error messages (prefix like ERROR/WARN, clear statement, potential next step).
These provide initial direction for Arch/SSE building the CLI skeleton and early adapters. They aren't final but set a baseline to build upon and review against (M2.1).

**(Facilitator):** You have UX reviews planned after core workflow (M2.1) and AI integration (M3.1). How do these reviews fit into the PM's sprint structure? Are they blocking activities?

**(UXE):** UX reviews should ideally happen *within* the sprint where the relevant functionality is developed or integrated, or early in the next sprint. 
*   **Timing:** Reviews shouldn't block merging code necessarily, but feedback should be incorporated quickly, ideally within the same or next sprint. It's a continuous feedback loop, not a final gate.
*   **Process:** Could involve reviewing PRs for output changes, pairing with devs, or reviewing output from specific test runs against the guidelines. Use the task tracker (PM Strategy #2) to log UX feedback as issues/sub-tasks.

**(Facilitator):** Milestone 3.1 focuses on reviewing the presentation of AI analysis. PO noted the risk of users being disappointed by V1's conservative AI. How can the UX design help manage expectations and clearly communicate the AI's limitations and confidence?

**(UXE):** This is critical (Strategy #4):
1.  **Explicit Labeling:** Clearly label AI-generated content (e.g., "AI Analysis:", "AI Suggestion:").
2.  **Source Attribution:** When AI bases analysis on specific evidence (e.g., changelog keyword), state it: "AI flagged potential break based on 'removed' keyword in changelog."
3.  **Confidence Indicators (Subtle):** V1 might not have fine-grained scores, but wording can help. Use phrases like "Potential breaking change identified based on major version bump" vs. "Breaking change likely due to explicit removal mentioned in changelog."
4.  **Explain Limitations:** Include a brief, one-time (?) explanation or link to docs stating the V1 AI focuses on high-confidence signals and isn't exhaustive (managing expectations proactively).
5.  **Provide Escape Hatches:** Ensure users can easily access raw tool outputs (#6) if they distrust or want to bypass the AI summary.

**(Facilitator):** Phase 4 involves usability testing. How do you ensure the feedback from these sessions (M4.4) translates into actionable refinements before V1 release (PM M4.5)?

**(UXE):** The Usability Testing Plan (M4.1) needs to define success metrics. Analysis (M4.4) involves:
1.  **Synthesizing Findings:** Grouping common issues, identifying severity (blocker, major, minor annoyance).
2.  **Prioritization:** Work with PO/PM to prioritize fixes based on severity and alignment with V1 goals.
3.  **Actionable Recommendations:** Provide concrete suggestions (e.g., "Reword confirmation prompt X for clarity," "Add flag Y to show detailed logs").
4.  **Tracking:** Log recommendations as tasks/bugs in the tracker, assigned for implementation during the stabilization sprints (PM Phase 4).
We must allocate time in PM Phase 4 specifically for addressing critical usability feedback.

**(Facilitator):** Your plan notes collaboration with SSE (documentation) and PE (explanation wording). How do you envision this working logistically?

**(UXE):** 
*   **SSE (Docs M5.1):** Review drafts of READMEs/examples from a user flow and clarity perspective. Provide feedback on structure, terminology, and task completion.
*   **PE (Wording M3.3):** Collaborate on the wording and tone guidelines (M1.2) initially. Review specific AI explanation templates/outputs generated based on PE prompts to ensure they are user-friendly, clear, and align with the established tone.
This likely involves shared document reviews, quick syncs, or pairing sessions as needed.

**(Facilitator):** Any concerns about accessibility being overlooked in a CLI tool?

**(UXE):** Yes, it's often overlooked. Key V1 considerations:
*   **Color Contrast:** Ensure default color choices for output (if used) have sufficient contrast or can be disabled/configured.
*   **Information Density:** Avoid overly dense or complexly formatted output that's hard to parse with screen readers.
*   **Clear Structure:** Use headings/clear sections in output where possible.
These need to be part of the Output Formatting Guidelines (M1.2) and checked during reviews (M2.1, M3.1).

**(Facilitator):** Any UX-specific blindspots, risks, or anti-patterns in the current plan?
*   **Risk:** Assuming the target persona (Jr. Devs?) fully understands all the underlying tools (git, package managers, testing). Explanations and error messages need to be clear without being overly verbose.
*   **Blindspot:** How configuration complexity (multiple tools, potential policies) impacts the initial setup/onboarding experience. Needs explicit design (PO Workflow #1, UXE M5.2).
*   **Anti-Pattern:** Inconsistent command structure or flag naming conventions across `scan`/`update` or future commands.

**(Facilitator):** Missing SMEs?

**(UXE):** **Technical Writers / Developer Relations** (as PO mentioned) are crucial for final documentation review (M5.1) and potentially creating tutorials/onboarding guides (M5.2).

**(Facilitator):** Thanks, UXE. Good focus on integrating UX activities into sprints, managing AI presentation challenges, usability testing feedback loops, accessibility, and potential onboarding complexity.
