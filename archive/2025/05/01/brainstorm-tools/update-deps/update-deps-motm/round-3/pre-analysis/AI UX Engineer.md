# AI UX Engineer - MotM Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Initial Milestones, Phases, Steps for V1 CLI (User Experience & Design Perspective)

Integrating UX design and evaluation into the V1 project plan:

**Proposed Phases & Milestones (UX Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & UX Definition** (Aligns with Arch/PA/PE Phase 1)
    *   *Dependency:* PO defines target persona (PO M1.2); Arch defines CLI structure.
    *   **UXE Milestone 1.1:** Define initial CLI Command Design (Asset #1 - commands, args, flags).
    *   **UXE Milestone 1.2:** Develop initial Output Formatting Guidelines (Asset #2) and Wording & Tone Guide (Asset #3).
    *   **UXE Milestone 1.3:** Design initial Progress Indicators (Asset #4) and basic Error Message structure (Asset #5).
    *   **UXE Milestone 1.4:** Conduct heuristic evaluation (Methodology #1) of the initial CLI design concepts.
2.  **Phase 2: Core Workflow Implementation & UX Review** (Aligns with Arch Phase 3, SSE Phase 2&3)
    *   *Dependency:* Core non-AI `scan` and `update` workflows are implemented.
    *   **UXE Milestone 2.1:** Review implementation of `scan`/`update` output against formatting/wording guidelines.
    *   **UXE Milestone 2.2:** Review implementation of confirmation prompts (#5) and rollback instructions (#8) for clarity and actionability (Strategy #3).
    *   **UXE Milestone 2.3:** Conduct cognitive walkthroughs (Methodology #2) of the core non-AI workflows with target persona in mind.
    *   **UXE Milestone 2.4:** Refine formatting guidelines and error messages based on initial implementation review.
3.  **Phase 3: AI Integration UX Review** (Aligns with Arch Phase 4, SSE Phase 4)
    *   *Dependency:* AI analysis features are integrated into CLI output.
    *   **UXE Milestone 3.1:** Review how AI analysis (summary, breaking changes, risk score) is presented. Ensure clear source attribution and confidence indicators are used (Strategy #4).
    *   **UXE Milestone 3.2:** Review progressive disclosure implementation (Strategy #1) - are details accessible via flags/hints?
    *   **UXE Milestone 3.3:** Review AI-generated explanations (#14) for clarity, tone, and adherence to guidelines.
4.  **Phase 4: Usability Testing & Refinement** (Aligns with PO/PM Phase 5 - Pilot)
    *   *Dependency:* V1 CLI (with/without initial AI) is stable enough for user testing.
    *   **UXE Milestone 4.1:** Finalize Usability Testing Plan (Asset #6).
    *   **UXE Milestone 4.2:** Recruit target users (Jr. Devs - R1/R2 Suggestion) for testing.
    *   **UXE Milestone 4.3:** Conduct usability testing sessions.
    *   **UXE Milestone 4.4:** Analyze usability findings and provide prioritized recommendations for pre-release refinements.
5.  **Phase 5: Documentation & Release Support**
    *   *Dependency:* V1 Release Candidate available.
    *   **UXE Milestone 5.1:** Review final user documentation (README, examples - SSE Asset #2) for clarity, accuracy, and completeness from a user perspective.
    *   **UXE Milestone 5.2:** Contribute to onboarding materials or tutorials (PO Workflow #1).

**Key Dependencies/Steps:**
*   UX guidelines (formatting, wording, commands) should be defined early (Phase 1) to guide implementation.
*   Reviewing implemented output against guidelines (Milestones 2.1, 3.1) is crucial throughout development.
*   Usability testing (Phase 4) provides essential validation but requires a relatively stable build.
*   Close collaboration with SSE (documentation), PE (explanation wording), and PO (user focus) is required.
*   Accessibility considerations (color, icons) must be part of reviews from Phase 2 onwards.
