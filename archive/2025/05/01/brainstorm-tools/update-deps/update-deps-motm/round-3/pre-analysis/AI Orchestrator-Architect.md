# AI Orchestrator/Architect - MotM Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Initial Milestones, Phases, Steps for V1 CLI (Orchestration & Architecture Perspective)

From an orchestration and core architecture standpoint, V1 development can be phased as follows:

**Proposed Phases & Milestones (Architecture Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Setup** (Aligns with PE Phase 1)
    *   **Arch Milestone 1.1:** Define & commit Technology Stack (PA Asset #1 - e.g., Python + Typer).
    *   **Arch Milestone 1.2:** Create CLI Application Skeleton (Asset #1) with basic command structure (`scan`, `update`, `init`, `config`, `help`).
    *   **Arch Milestone 1.3:** Implement Configuration Module & define initial Schema (Asset #5).
    *   **Arch Milestone 1.4:** Define Orchestrator State Machine (Asset #2) and basic state management implementation (Asset #7 - file-based).
    *   **Arch Milestone 1.5:** Define Tool Adapter Interface (Asset #3).
2.  **Phase 2: Core Tool Adapter Implementation** (Aligns with PE Phase 2)
    *   **Arch Milestone 2.1:** Implement `GitAdapter` (Asset #4) with branching/rollback logic.
    *   **Arch Milestone 2.2:** Implement `TestRunnerAdapter` (Asset #4) using configured `testCommand`.
    *   **Arch Milestone 2.3:** Implement *First* `PackageManagerAdapter` (Asset #4 - e.g., NpmAdapter) covering core actions: resolve, install/update, integrity check.
    *   **Arch Milestone 2.4:** Implement basic `VulnerabilityScannerAdapter` & `LicenseCheckerAdapter` (Asset #4) (assuming simple CLI wrappers initially).
    *   **Arch Milestone 2.5:** Implement Tool Adapter integration tests (Methodology #1) for adapters built.
3.  **Phase 3: Core Workflow Orchestration (No AI)**
    *   *Dependency:* Phase 1 & 2 Milestones complete.
    *   **Arch Milestone 3.1:** Implement the `scan` command workflow (Workflow #1) using adapters *without* the AI summarization step.
    *   **Arch Milestone 3.2:** Implement the `update` command workflow (Workflow #2) *without* AI analysis/conflict resolution steps, focusing on branching, applying updates, running tests, reporting pass/fail, and rollback.
    *   **Arch Milestone 3.3:** Implement basic E2E workflow tests (Methodology #2) for the non-AI `scan` and `update` paths.
    *   **Arch Milestone 3.4 (MVP Candidate):** Core CLI tool is functional end-to-end for one ecosystem using deterministic tool outputs only (Supports PA Strategy #2, PO MVP definition).
4.  **Phase 4: AI Integration & Enhancement** (Aligns with PE Phase 3 & 4)
    *   *Dependency:* Phase 3 complete; AIE implements AI Interaction Module.
    *   **Arch Milestone 4.1:** Integrate AI Interaction Module calls into the `scan` workflow for summarization.
    *   **Arch Milestone 4.2:** Integrate AI Interaction Module calls into the `update` workflow for breaking change analysis, conflict resolution aid, and test failure explanations.
    *   **Arch Milestone 4.3:** Refine error handling strategy (Strategy #2) to incorporate AI explanation failures.
5.  **Phase 5: CI Integration & Release Prep** (Aligns with PE Phase 5)
    *   *Dependency:* AI features integrated and basic evaluation passed.
    *   **Arch Milestone 5.1:** Implement `--ci` mode for `scan` command with JSON output (PA Workflow #1).
    *   **Arch Milestone 5.2:** Finalize configuration options and documentation.
    *   **Arch Milestone 5.3:** Conduct performance benchmarking (PA Method #3).
    *   **Arch Milestone 5.4:** Package tool for release.

**Key Dependencies/Steps:**
*   The core, non-AI workflow (Phase 3) should be functional before layering on AI analysis (Phase 4). This provides a stable baseline.
*   Tool Adapters need robust testing (Milestone 2.5) before being integrated into workflows.
*   Clear interfaces between the Orchestrator, Adapters, and AI Module are crucial for parallel development and maintainability (PA Strategy #5).
*   Need early decision on V1 ecosystem(s) to prioritize `PackageManagerAdapter` work.
*   Secure tool execution practices (Strategy #1) must be implemented from the start of adapter development.
