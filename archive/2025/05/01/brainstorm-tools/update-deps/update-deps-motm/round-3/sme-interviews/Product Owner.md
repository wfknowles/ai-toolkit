# Product Owner - MotM Round 3 SME Interview

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Interviewee:** Product Owner (PO)
**Interviewer:** Facilitator
**Input:** `/Users/wknowles/Develop/ai/wfkAi/brain/knowledge/chronological/2025/05/01/brainstorm-tools/update-deps/update-deps-motm/round-3/pre-analysis/Product Owner.md`
**Context:** R1/R2 Analysis, R3 Pre-Planning Synthesis

**(Facilitator):** Your plan emphasizes early MVP definition (M1.1) and target ecosystem choice (M1.3). How quickly do these decisions need to be finalized to avoid blocking downstream work (Arch/SSE Phase 1)?

**(PO):** These are Phase 0 / Sprint 0 decisions. The target ecosystem choice *must* be made before Arch/SSE start building the first `PackageManagerAdapter` (Arch M2.3). The core MVP user stories (M1.1) defining the non-AI scan/update loop need to be agreed upon at the very start of Phase 1 development to guide the foundational work. We can refine stories later, but the core scope needs clarity immediately.

**(Facilitator):** You propose internal validation (M2.2) after the non-AI MVP build, then integrating AI (Phase 3) and security/usability (Phase 4) as "fast-follows." Arch, SSE, and PA have argued for integrating core security checks (integrity/confusion) earlier, in Phase 3 alongside core workflow. What's your view on this from a product value and risk perspective?

**(PO):** That's a fair challenge. My initial thought was to get *something* functional (the basic update loop) validated quickly (Phase 2), then layer enhancements. However, the arguments that these security checks are foundational to a *trustworthy* update process are compelling. A tool that updates dependencies but ignores basic integrity checks feels incomplete, even for an MVP. If the technical consensus (Arch/SSE/PA) is that integrating them in Phase 3 is cleaner and doesn't drastically increase complexity, I'm willing to adjust. We should prioritize building a *secure* core workflow first. This means **revising the plan**: integrate core security checks (integrity/confusion) into Phase 2 (MVP Build) or very early Phase 3, *before* the main AI analysis features.

**(Facilitator):** Following that, within the AI Analysis (now maybe later Phase 3) and Usability Enhancements (Phase 4), how will you prioritize? For example, is AI Breaking Change analysis (#2) more valuable initially than improved Conflict Resolution (#4)?

**(PO):** That's the classic value vs. effort vs. risk prioritization. My initial leaning:
1.  **AI Scan Summary (#10):** Provides immediate overview value, relatively low risk if just summarizing adapter outputs.
2.  **AI Breaking Change (#2) (Conservative V1):** High potential value, but also high risk if inaccurate. The PE's conservative approach helps, but we need to validate its utility quickly.
3.  **Usability - Config Overrides (#7):** High value for adapting to different projects.
4.  **Usability - Enhanced Conflict Resolution (#4):** Value depends on how often complex conflicts occur in the target ecosystem.
5.  **AI Risk/Urgency Score (#13):** High value, but defining good heuristics (M3.2) might be complex.
This requires team discussion (sprint planning) weighing perceived value against estimated effort/complexity for each user story.

**(Facilitator):** Milestone 3.2 involves defining V1 heuristics for Risk/Urgency and Effort. Who needs to be involved, and how complex do you anticipate this being?

**(PO):** This needs input from PO (business impact), SSE/Arch (technical factors influencing risk/effort), PE (how to explain this to the AI), and potentially data from early usage/pilot. Initial V1 heuristics might be simple: e.g., Risk = (High if major version bump OR critical vuln) + (Medium if minor bump with breaking keyword); Effort = (Simple bucket based on file changes/test failures). We should start simple and iterate. Complexity lies in finding heuristics that are generally useful without being overly simplistic or requiring excessive configuration.

**(Facilitator):** Your plan includes feedback loops via internal validation (M2.3) and a pilot program (M5.3). How will we ensure this feedback is effectively captured and used to refine V1 or plan V1.1 (M6.2)?

**(PO):** We need structured processes:
*   **Internal Validation (M2.3):** Use specific testing scenarios, capture issues/feedback in the main tracking tool (PM Strategy #2). Hold a dedicated review session.
*   **Pilot Program (M5.3):** Clear entry/exit criteria, defined participant group, structured feedback channels (e.g., dedicated Slack channel, feedback sessions, surveys), regular check-ins. Feedback needs to be triaged (bugs vs. suggestions), prioritized, and explicitly fed into the backlog for V1 refinement (M5.4) or V1.1 planning (M6.2).

**(Facilitator):** From a product perspective, what's the biggest risk or potential blindspot in the current V1 plan?
*   **Risk:** The AI analysis features (Breaking Changes, Summaries) might not provide enough reliable value in their V1 conservative form to justify the complexity, potentially disappointing early users expecting more intelligence. Managing expectations (UXE Strategy #4) is key.
*   **Blindspot:** We haven't explicitly planned for collecting *usage metrics* (PA M5.3) beyond pilot feedback. Understanding *how* people use the tool (which commands, flags, success/failure rates) is vital for V1.1 prioritization. We need to define key usage metrics early and ensure they're instrumented.

**(Facilitator):** Any previous decisions needing review?
*   **Decision Review:** Confirming the revised phasing of core security checks (Integrity/Confusion) into the MVP build phase (earlier than original PO plan).

**(Facilitator):** Missing SMEs?

**(PO):** Maybe **Developer Relations / Technical Writers** for helping craft the user documentation (M5.2) and ensuring the value proposition is communicated clearly during pilot/release. Also, confirming **Customer Support / End-User Support** (from R1) for input on business context tagging if we pursue that.

**(Facilitator):** Thanks, PO. Good discussion on adjusting security check phasing, prioritization criteria, defining heuristics, structured feedback, and managing expectations for V1 AI capabilities.
