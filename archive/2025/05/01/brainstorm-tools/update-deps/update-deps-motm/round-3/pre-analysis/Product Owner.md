# Product Owner - MotM Round 3 Pre-Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Focus:** Initial Milestones, Phases, Steps for V1 CLI (Product Value & Release Perspective)

Structuring the V1 project to deliver incremental value and gather feedback effectively:

**Proposed Phases & Milestones (Product Value Focus):**

1.  **Phase 1: Core Workflow MVP Definition & Foundation**
    *   **PO Milestone 1.1:** Define detailed User Stories & Acceptance Criteria for the absolute MVP (Strategy #1, R2 Interview) covering the Scan->Branch->Update->Test->Report loop for one ecosystem, *without* AI analysis initially.
    *   **PO Milestone 1.2:** Define initial target user persona(s) for V1 (Asset #1).
    *   **PO Milestone 1.3:** Decide and document the target V1 ecosystem (Node or Python - R2 Req #6).
    *   *Dependency:* Arch/SSE implement foundational CLI & core adapters.
2.  **Phase 2: MVP Build & Internal Validation**
    *   *Dependency:* Core non-AI workflow is implemented (Arch M3.4).
    *   **PO Milestone 2.1:** MVP candidate ready for internal validation (basic scan/update loop works deterministically).
    *   **PO Milestone 2.2:** Conduct initial internal testing/dogfooding of the non-AI MVP with a small group (e.g., dev team itself).
    *   **PO Milestone 2.3:** Gather initial feedback on core workflow usability and reliability (Strategy #2).
3.  **Phase 3: AI Analysis Layer Integration (Fast-Follow)**
    *   *Dependency:* MVP validated; AI Interaction module ready (AIE); PE prompt templates drafted.
    *   **PO Milestone 3.1:** Prioritize which AI analysis features (Breaking Change #2, Summary #10, Risk #13) provide the most value and integrate first.
    *   **PO Milestone 3.2:** Define V1 heuristics for Risk/Urgency Score (#13) and Effort Buckets (#3 R1 Refinement) (Assets #4, #5).
    *   **PO Milestone 3.3:** Define user stories for integrating AI analysis features into `scan` and `update`.
    *   **PO Milestone 3.4:** AI-enhanced CLI ready for further validation.
4.  **Phase 4: Security & Usability Enhancements (Fast-Follow)**
    *   *Dependency:* Core workflow + initial AI layer functional.
    *   **PO Milestone 4.1:** Prioritize and define user stories for integrating core security checks (Integrity, Dep Confusion - SE points).
    *   **PO Milestone 4.2:** Define user stories for key usability improvements identified (e.g., config overrides #7, enhanced conflict resolution #4).
    *   **PO Milestone 4.3:** Incorporate initial developer feedback (SSE Method #1) into backlog refinement.
5.  **Phase 5: Pilot Program & V1 Release Candidate**
    *   *Dependency:* Core features, AI analysis, key security/usability additions implemented and tested.
    *   **PO Milestone 5.1:** Define scope and participants for internal Pilot Program (Strategy #4).
    *   **PO Milestone 5.2:** Develop Onboarding materials (Workflow #1) and User Documentation (SSE Asset #2).
    *   **PO Milestone 5.3:** Launch Pilot Program and gather structured feedback (Strategy #2).
    *   **PO Milestone 5.4:** Address critical feedback from pilot; V1 Release Candidate ready.
6.  **Phase 6: V1 Release & Iteration Planning**
    *   **PO Milestone 6.1:** V1 Official Release.
    *   **PO Milestone 6.2:** Analyze pilot feedback and early usage data (Metrics - PA Asset #5) to prioritize the backlog for V1.1 / V2 (Methodology #3).

**Key Dependencies/Steps:**
*   Decoupling the AI analysis (Phase 3/4) from the core workflow MVP (Phase 2) allows for earlier validation of the fundamental mechanics.
*   Prioritization within the "Fast-Follow" phases (3 & 4) is key â€“ do we add AI breaking changes before integrity checks? This needs discussion based on perceived value vs. risk.
*   User feedback loops (Milestones 2.3, 5.3, 6.2) are critical milestones for validating direction and refining priorities.
*   Defining the initial target ecosystem (Milestone 1.3) is an early, critical path decision.
