## 3. Key Decisions Summary (Round 3)

1.  **Security Check Phasing:** Core checks (Integrity, Dep Confusion) moved earlier into MVP build phase (Phase 2/early 3).
2.  **V1 Breaking Change Heuristic:** Use explicit keywords (changelog) & major version bumps. Link to changelog. Investigate linking code usage if feasible. Communicate limitations clearly via UX.
3.  **V1 Configuration Management:** Use Env Vars / documented config file. Implement basic secure loading. Defer full CI/Secret Mgmt strategy.
4.  **V1 API Rate Limits/Costs:** Implement basic retry logic (LLM Client, Adapters). Log token usage. Rely on manual log review for V1 cost monitoring. Defer automated monitoring/alerting.
5.  **V1 AI Expectation Management:** Reinforce UX strategies (labeling, source attribution, limitations disclaimer, escape hatches). Involve DevRel/TechWriters for messaging.
6.  **V1 Environment Management:** Rely on user environment setup guided by clear prerequisite documentation. Defer `check-env` command.
7.  **Data Correlation Testing:** Add explicit integration tests for mapping data between adapter outputs within the orchestrator.
8.  **V1 State Management:** Proceed with file-based state, acknowledging V1 limitations.

## 4. Identified Risks & Mitigation (V1 Focus)

*   **Risk:** Adapter output instability/inconsistency delays PE/AIE/Core Logic.
    *   **Mitigation:** Define clear Adapter Contracts early (PA M0.3). Integration testing (SSE). Frequent communication (PM Asset #5).
*   **Risk:** Tight coupling between Orchestrator and first PkgMgr Adapter.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict interface adherence. Standardized data structures. Early design for 2nd adapter. Code reviews (Arch/PA).
*   **Risk:** File-based state management limitations (concurrency, corruption).
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement basic file locking/error handling around state I/O (Arch task). Accept V1 scalability limits.
*   **Risk:** Conservative V1 AI analysis provides low perceived value.
    *   **Mitigation:** Manage expectations via UX/Docs (UXE/PO/DevRel). Focus on actionability (linking evidence/usage). Plan fast-follows based on pilot feedback.
*   **Risk:** Misaligned dependencies/handoffs between phases/teams.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clear contracts. Cross-functional reviews. Explicit integration tasks. Frequent communication (PM).
*   **Risk:** AI Tuning (prompts, eval) takes longer than estimated.
    *   **Mitigation:** Allocate % sprint capacity buffer. Explicit tuning tasks. Flexible scope during AI sprints (PM).
*   **Risk:** Team Velocity uncertainty (new tech/AI).
    *   **Mitigation:** Acknowledge uncertainty in initial estimates. Adjust plan based on early sprint data (PM).
*   **Risk:** External tool/LLM API changes, downtime, or rate limits.
    *   **Mitigation:** Basic retry logic. Graceful failure handling. Monitor via logs in V1 (Arch/AIE).
*   **Risk:** Configuration complexity hinders onboarding/usability.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clear documentation. Default sensible values. UX review of setup process. Consider `check-env` for V1.1 (UXE/SSE).
*   **Risk:** LLM reliability/consistency issues.
    *   **Mitigation:** Robust output parsing (AIE). Retry logic (AIE). Failure handling.
*   **Risk:** Prompt Injection / Security issues via context.
    *   **Mitigation:** Basic input sanitization in Context Builder (AIE). Awareness.

## 5. Key Dependencies

*   **Internal:**
    *   Core Logic / AI depends on stable Adapter Interfaces & Output.
    *   AI Integration depends on PE Prompts & AIE Modules.
    *   Testing/Refinement depends on functional builds & feedback loops.
    *   PM execution depends on timely Phase 0 decisions.
*   **External:**
    *   Availability & Stability of chosen LLM.
    *   Availability & Stability of external scanners/tools used by adapters.
    *   Availability of target users for Pilot Program & Usability Testing.
*   **Personnel/SME Needs:**
    *   **Critical for V1:** Core Team (PM, PO, PA, Arch, SSE, PE, UXE, AIE).
    *   **Needed for V1 Success:** Ecosystem Experts (for target V1 system), DevOps/SRE (for CI, config strategy input, monitoring setup), Security Engineering (for config review), Tech Writers/DevRel (for docs/messaging).
