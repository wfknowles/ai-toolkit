# Product Owner - Pre-Analysis: AI Dependency Update Assistant Concepts

**Objective:** Identify concepts focused on the value proposition, usability for less technical users (if applicable), and alignment with product goals.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Value Proposition Clarity:** Frame the tool's output in terms of user/business value – e.g., "Update recommended to fix critical security issue CVE-XXXX impacting user data security," or "Update enables new feature Y."
2.  **Risk/Reward Summary:** Provide a high-level summary of the risks (e.g., potential breaking changes, stability concerns) versus rewards (security fixes, new features, performance gains) for proposed updates.
3.  **Policy Adherence Check:** Ensure updates align with product-level policies regarding acceptable licenses (link to CISO-2) or approved/disapproved dependencies.
4.  **Feature Enablement Identification:** Highlight if a dependency update unblocks or is required for planned product features or improvements.
5.  **User-Facing Impact Assessment:** Assess if a dependency update might have noticeable user-facing impacts (e.g., performance changes, UI library updates affecting look-and-feel) and flag for review.
6.  **Update Urgency Indicator:** Classify recommended updates by urgency (e.g., Critical Security, Recommended Feature, Routine Maintenance) to help prioritize review and action.
7.  **Simplified Explanation Option:** Offer different levels of detail in explanations, including a simplified summary suitable for less technical stakeholders who need to approve or be aware of the changes.
8.  **Batch Update Rationale:** If proposing multiple updates, provide a rationale for the batch – e.g., "Updating these related libraries together maintains compatibility."
9.  **Changelog Summarization (Feature Focus):** Summarize dependency changelogs focusing on new features or bug fixes relevant to the product, not just technical details.
