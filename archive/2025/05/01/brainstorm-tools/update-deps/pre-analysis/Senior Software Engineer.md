# Senior Software Engineer - Pre-Analysis: AI Dependency Update Assistant Concepts

**Objective:** Identify concepts focused on the practical coding aspects, minimizing disruption, ensuring compatibility, and aiding the developer workflow.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Breaking Change Analysis & Code Mod Suggestions:** Automatically scan changelogs *and* analyze code usage patterns to identify potential breaking changes in API usage due to an update. Suggest necessary code modifications (codemods) or provide warnings.
2.  **Automated Test Execution Trigger:** After applying updates (even tentatively in a separate branch), automatically trigger the project's test suite (`unit`, `integration`) to provide immediate feedback on compatibility.
3.  **Incremental Update Strategy:** Offer strategies for incremental updates (e.g., update only patch versions first, update one major dependency at a time) to reduce the complexity and risk of large-batch updates.
4.  **Lockfile Consistency Check:** Ensure updates maintain consistency between the dependency declaration file (e.g., `package.json`) and the lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json`), resolving discrepancies correctly.
5.  **Code Refactoring for Deprecated APIs:** Identify usage of deprecated methods from dependencies being updated and suggest or perform refactoring to use the recommended newer APIs.
6.  **Minimal Version Bumping:** Prioritize updating to the *minimum* version that satisfies requirements (e.g., security patch, compatibility) rather than always jumping to `latest`, to minimize unnecessary code churn or risk.
7.  **Staged Application (Branching Strategy):** Recommend or automatically implement updates in a separate Git branch, facilitating review, testing, and easy rollback.
8.  **Dependency Usage Context:** Provide context to the developer on *where* and *how* a specific dependency is used in the codebase to help them assess the impact of an update.
9.  **Conflict Resolution Explanation:** When dependency conflicts occur, clearly explain the conflicting requirements (e.g., "LibA requires LibC v1, but LibB requires LibC v2") to help the developer understand the root cause.
