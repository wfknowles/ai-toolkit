# Security Engineer - Pre-Analysis: AI Dependency Update Assistant Concepts

**Objective:** Identify concepts focusing on the detailed security mechanisms, checks, and potential attack vectors related to dependency management.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Dependency Confusion Prevention:** Check if proposed internal package names exist in public repositories to prevent dependency confusion attacks before adding or updating internal dependencies.
2.  **Malicious Script Detection in Packages:** (Advanced) Attempt to scan package contents (especially install scripts `postinstall`) for potentially malicious code patterns beyond simple vulnerability DB checks.
3.  **Transitive Dependency Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score not just to direct dependencies but aggregate risk from the entire transitive dependency tree, highlighting high-risk indirect dependencies.
4.  **Secure Version Pinning Recommendation:** Recommend pinning dependencies (using lockfiles) as a security best practice to ensure reproducible builds and prevent unexpected updates.
5.  **Integrity Hash Verification:** Ensure the package manager is configured to verify integrity hashes (e.g., `npm ci` vs `npm install`, checking hashes in `yarn.lock` or `poetry.lock`) during the install/update process executed or suggested by the AI.
6.  **Differential Analysis Post-Update:** After an update, perform a differential analysis comparing the old and new versions of package code (where feasible) to spot unexpected or suspicious changes.
7.  **Build Environment Security Context:** Inject context about the build environment's security posture, potentially restricting updates that require riskier build steps or permissions.
8.  **Security Contact/Reporting Information:** For flagged vulnerabilities, attempt to retrieve security contact information for the package maintainers or links to official reporting channels.
9.  **Attack Surface Monitoring:** Analyze how dependency updates might change the project's overall attack surface (e.g., adding network-facing components, new parsers for untrusted input).
