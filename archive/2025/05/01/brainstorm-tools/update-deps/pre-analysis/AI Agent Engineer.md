# AI Agent Engineer - Pre-Analysis: AI Dependency Update Assistant Concepts

**Objective:** Identify concepts for enabling the AI assistant to act more autonomously or as part of a larger automated maintenance system.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Multi-Step Planning for Updates:** Enable the AI to generate a plan for complex updates involving multiple dependencies, potential code mods, and testing steps. (e.g., "Plan: 1. Update LibA. 2. Run tests. 3. Analyze LibB for breaking changes. 4. Suggest Code Mods for LibB usage. 5. Update LibB. 6. Run all tests.")
2.  **Tool Integration for Analysis:** Equip the agent with tools to directly invoke vulnerability scanners (CISO-1), license checkers (CISO-2), test runners (SSE-2), and static code analysis (SSE-1).
3.  **Automated Changelog Parsing Tool:** Develop or integrate a tool specifically for parsing various changelog formats to reliably extract breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes (supports PE-3, SSE-1).
4.  **Self-Correction during Resolution:** If an initial attempt to resolve dependencies or apply an update fails (e.g., tests break), allow the AI agent to attempt self-correction by trying alternative versions or suggesting different conflict resolutions.
5.  **Learning from Past Updates:** (Advanced) Enable the agent to learn from past successful or failed updates within the same project or across similar projects to improve future suggestions and risk assessments.
6.  **Autonomous Mode (Optional/Risky):** Define a potential (high-risk, requires extensive safety checks) autonomous mode where the agent attempts to perform routine patch-level security updates automatically, creating a PR for review.
7.  **Information Gathering for Unknowns:** If encountering an unknown conflict or obscure dependency, enable the agent to use search tools to find relevant GitHub issues, Stack Overflow discussions, or documentation.
8.  **Simulation/Dry-Run Capability:** Allow the agent to perform a 'dry run' of the update process, simulating dependency resolution and potential conflicts without actually modifying files or running installs.
9.  **Reasoning Explanation (Chain-of-Thought):** Force the agent to explain its reasoning for choosing specific versions, identifying conflicts, or assessing risks, enhancing transparency and debuggability.
