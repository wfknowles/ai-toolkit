# CISO - Pre-Analysis: AI Dependency Update Assistant Concepts

**Objective:** Identify concepts focusing on the security risks and mitigations associated with AI-assisted dependency updates.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Vulnerability Scanning Integration:** Mandate checking proposed dependency updates against known vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, OSV, Snyk DB) *before* suggesting or applying them.
2.  **License Compliance Check:** Integrate checks for license compatibility and organizational policy adherence for all new or updated dependencies and their transitive dependencies.
3.  **Supply Chain Risk Assessment:** Analyze metadata of updated dependencies (e.g., author reputation, recent changes, download counts, signs of typo-squatting) to flag potentially malicious or compromised packages.
4.  **Least Privilege Update Principle:** Default to suggesting the *minimum safe version update* that resolves known security issues or meets requirements, rather than always jumping to the absolute latest version, which might be less stable or introduce new risks.
5.  **Transitive Dependency Security Scan:** Explicitly scan not just the directly updated dependency but also all *new or changed transitive dependencies* for vulnerabilities and license issues.
6.  **Rollback Plan Requirement:** Ensure the AI assistant always proposes or helps generate a clear rollback plan (e.g., Git commands, specific version pins) before applying any dependency changes.
7.  **Blocklist/Allowlist Enforcement:** Integrate with organizational policies defining forbidden dependencies/licenses or requiring dependencies to be on an approved list.
8.  **Secrets Detection in Build/Lock Files:** Scan lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `Gemfile.lock`) or build scripts for inadvertently committed secrets that might be exposed during the update process.
9.  **Security Context Injection:** Ensure the AI prompt includes context about known security requirements or sensitive areas of the project, guiding it to be more cautious when suggesting updates impacting those areas.
