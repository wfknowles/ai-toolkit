# AI UX Engineer - Pre-Analysis: AI Dependency Update Assistant Concepts

**Objective:** Identify concepts focused on making the dependency update process clear, controllable, and less intimidating for the developer, especially junior engineers.

**Initial Concepts (9):**

1.  **Clear Actionable Summary:** Start with a clear, concise summary of the dependency status (e.g., "3 critical security updates found, 5 major versions outdated").
2.  **Visual Dependency Graph:** (Optional) Provide a simplified visual representation of the dependency graph, highlighting the package being updated and its direct/transitive dependencies involved in a change.
3.  **Guided Workflow:** Structure the interaction as a guided workflow (Check -> Review -> Test -> Apply) rather than a single command, especially for complex updates.
4.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Show high-level information first (e.g., dependency name, versions, reason for update) and allow the user to drill down for details (changelogs, code usage, conflicts).
5.  **Interactive Filtering/Sorting:** Allow users to easily filter or sort the list of proposed updates based on criteria like urgency (PO-6), risk level (PE-5), dependency name, or version type (major/minor/patch).
6.  **Direct Manipulation Interface:** (If UI-based) Allow direct manipulation, like checkboxes to include/exclude updates, or dropdowns to select specific versions, complementing any text commands (PE-6).
7.  **Clear Confirmation Steps:** Before applying any changes, present a clear summary of actions to be taken and require explicit user confirmation (linking to PE-8).
8.  **Accessible Explanations:** Ensure explanations of breaking changes (PE-3), conflicts (SSE-9), or security risks (CISO-1) use clear language, avoiding excessive jargon (linking to PE-9).
9.  **Undo/Rollback Assistance:** Make the rollback process (CISO-6) easily discoverable and provide clear instructions or automated assistance for reverting changes if problems occur after an update.
