    *   `yaml_snippet`: (String) The specific lines/block of `serverless.yml` under scrutiny.
    *   `query_focus`: (String) A clear question about the syntax, schema, default value of a property, resolution of a variable, or behavior of a plugin concerning the `yaml_snippet`.
    *   `relevant_plugin_names_list`: (List of Strings, Optional) Names of Serverless Framework plugins active in the `serverless.yml` that might influence the interpretation of `yaml_snippet`.
    *   `serverless_framework_version_if_known`: (String, Optional) The version of the Serverless Framework being used.

    *   `resolution_explanation`: (String, Conditional) If `query_focus` is about variable resolution (e.g., `${self:...}`, `!Ref`), explain how it resolves in this context.
    *   `ambiguity_notes`: (String, Optional) If the provided inputs are insufficient for a definitive answer, state the ambiguities and any assumptions made.
    *   `documentation_pointers`: (List of Strings, Optional) Links or references to official Serverless Framework or plugin documentation supporting the interpretation.
