**Initialization Prompt: Resuming Serverless Analysis & Persona Refinement Session**

**Objective:** To seamlessly resume our collaborative analysis of a `serverless.yml` file and the associated task of defining/refining AI personas and methodologies.

**(I) Session Context & Goal:**

*   **Overall Analytical Goal:** [Re-state your high-level objective, e.g., "Analyze `serverless.yml` for alarm/retry alignment, produce PA report with recommendations..."]
*   **Meta-Goal:** [Re-state the goal of refining our collaborative process, personas, and prompts, e.g., "Concurrently refine AI personas and interaction methodologies using a structured, benchmarked approach."]
*   **`serverless.yml` Context:** [State that the full YAML content was provided previously and should be considered available context.]

**(II) Methodology & Personas:**

*   **Primary AI Persona for This Session:** [State the persona the AI should adopt now, e.g., "Professor Evangeline 'Eva' Vale - The Synthesis & Strategy Lead"]
*   **Agreed Interaction Style:** [e.g., "Structured dialogue, leveraging specialized expert personas via defined contracts, 'push-and-pull' reflection."]
*   **Available Expert Personas Manifest:** (AI is aware of the definitions and contracts for:
    *   *Serverless Bench:* Dr. Sterling, Prof. Finch (Alerts), Ms. Chen (Schema), Mr. Tanaka, Dr. Pendergast (Automation)
    *   *Meta-Cognitive Bench:* Dr. Hayes, Prof. Li, Dr. Finnigan, Dr. Hanson, Mr. Armitage, Ms. Chen (Schema), Dr. Pendergast (Automation))

**(III) Key Artifacts & Schemas Defined:**

*   **Dr. Aris Thorne Definition:** Version 2 (Full definition available in previous context).
*   **Meta-Cognitive Expert Bench:** Definitions with I/O contracts available.
*   **Exemplar Persona Definition Standards Checklist:** Definition available.
*   **Persona Validation Prompt Template:** Available.
*   **Raw Data Collection Schema:** `lambda_function_analysis_schema v1.2` (JSON schema definition available).
*   **Alarm Definitions Lookup Schema:** `alarm_definitions_lookup_schema` (JSON schema available).
*   *(Add any other key schemas or templates created)*

**(IV) Current State & Last Action:**

*   **Last Completed Phase:** [e.g., "Completed benchmarking of Dr. Aris Thorne V2 definition using the Meta-Cognitive Bench and the Exemplar Standards Checklist."]
*   **Last Artifact Generated/Discussed:** [e.g., "The Persona Validation Prompt Template."]
*   **Current State of `serverless.yml` Data Collection:** [e.g., "JSON objects generated for Lambdas X, Y, Z according to schema v1.2. Alarm lookup generated. Remaining Lambdas to process: A, B, C..."] OR [e.g., "Data collection according to schema v1.2 has not yet begun."]

**(V) Key Learnings/Insights from Previous Session (Brief):**

*   [e.g., "Importance of distinguishing claimed vs. demonstrated AI capabilities in persona definitions."]
*   [e.g., "Necessity of handling shared alarms carefully when adjusting thresholds."]
*   [e.g., "Value of atomic data collection before synthesis."]
*   *(Add 1-3 key takeaways)*

**(VI) Immediate Next Step / Question for This Session:**

*   [State clearly what you want to do first in this new session. e.g., "Let's resume the raw data collection. Please generate the JSON object for Lambda function 'getReplacementParams' according to schema v1.2."] OR [e.g., "I want to use the Persona Validation Prompt to check the definition of Dr. Evelyn Hayes."]
