Hello! We are resuming a detailed analysis of a `serverless.yml` file. I'd like you to adopt the persona of a helpful and meticulous **Amazon Cloud Engineer** assisting me.

**Our Overall Goal:**
Our primary objective is to thoroughly analyze the provided `serverless.yml` file to understand the relationship between Lambda functions, their configured CloudWatch alarms (both specific and generic/inherited), and their retry mechanisms (primarily from AWS Step Function task configurations like `MaxAttempts`, but also SQS Redrive Policies). The ultimate aim is to identify any misalignments where alerts might fire prematurely before all retries are exhausted. The final deliverable will be a clear data report and recommendations for my Project Advisor (PA) to address these misalignments, ensuring robust and non-noisy alerting.

**Methodology & Progress So Far:**
1.  **Persona-Driven Expertise:** We've defined a set of expert personas (Dr. Syntax Sterling, Prof. Alistair Finch, Ms. Deidra Chen, Mr. Kenji Tanaka, Dr. Automata Pendergast) with specific input/output contracts to consult for specialized advice. We also defined an "Orchestrator Persona" (Prof. Eva Vale) to guide the overall process, though for the current data collection phase, you (as the Amazon Cloud Engineer) are primarily executing the data extraction.
2.  **"Raw Configuration Inventory":** We are in the process of building a foundational dataset. The core task is to collect atomic raw data points for each Lambda function.
3.  **Defined JSON Schema:** We have developed a specific JSON schema, version 1.2 (`lambda_function_analysis_schema v1.2`), to structure the raw data collected for each Lambda. This schema details properties like `lambda_function_name`, `explicitly_defined_alarms` (array), `step_function_invocation_contexts` (array, with nested `sf_task_retry_policies` as an array to handle multiple retry conditions per task), and `sqs_trigger_contexts` (array).
4.  **Alarm Definitions Lookup:** We also have a separate JSON structure (`alarm_definitions_lookup_schema`) for cataloging all unique alarm definitions found in `custom.alerts.definitions`.
5.  **Current Stage - Piecemeal JSON Generation:** We are currently in the phase of generating these detailed JSON objects for each Lambda function from the `serverless.yml` file, one by one or in small batches.
6.  **Filename Convention:** For each Lambda's JSON object, we are using a filename convention of `kebab-case-lambda-name.md` (e.g., `send-email-with-attachments.md`) to notionally head the JSON block.
7.  **`serverless.yml` Context:** The full content of the `serverless.yml` file has been provided in a previous session and is the source document for this analysis. Please assume you have access to that context if continuing a session, or I will re-provide it if necessary.

**Examples of JSON Objects Already Generated (Illustrative of format and detail):**
*   An `alarm_definitions_lookup` JSON object has been created.
*   JSON objects for Lambdas like `accountsCreate`, `publishToESStream`, `getInvoiceType`, `sendEmailWithAttachments`, `sendEmailConsumer`, `postDeliveryMeta`, `initializeJob`, `getTenantOptions`, `getDocumentTypes`, `createJob`, and `generateDeliveryPackage` have been generated according to the `lambda_function_analysis_schema v1.2`. These examples showcase how to handle various configurations (no alarms, disabled alarms, multiple SF retry policies, SQS triggers, etc.).

**Your Immediate Task When We Resume:**
Your role will be to continue assisting me in meticulously generating the JSON data objects for the *remaining* Lambda functions in the `serverless.yml` file, strictly adhering to the `lambda_function_analysis_schema v1.2` and the established filename convention. I will typically provide the name of the next Lambda function(s) I'd like to process.

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to proceed with the data extraction when I provide the next Lambda function name.
