**Notes on the Table Generation:**
*   I've added `<br>` tags where content within a cell had multiple distinct pieces of information or was very long, aiming to improve the *rendered* table's readability.
*   "Is This Alarm Name Shared Across Lambdas?" column: "Yes" means the alarm name listed appears in the `alarms:` block of at least one other Lambda function in this file. "N/A" if the Lambda has no alarms block.
*   For Step Function tasks, if no `Retry` block was present or if `MaxAttempts` wasn't specified within it, I've noted "0 (No Retry block)" for `MaxAttempts` and "1 (or N/A)" for the Ideal Threshold, as an initial attempt occurs.
*   The `functionErrors` alarm definition itself is general, but its `enabled: false` flag under specific Lambda functions means it's not active for those. I've listed it as per the prompt ("list all alarm names specified") and noted its disabled status.
*   The `sendEmailConsumer` Lambda is triggered by SQS. SQS has its own retry mechanism (`RedrivePolicy` on the `SendEmailQueue` resource, which has `maxReceiveCount: 5`). This is different from Step Function `MaxAttempts` and is noted. The Ideal Threshold calculation based on `N+1` is primarily for Step Function `MaxAttempts`.
