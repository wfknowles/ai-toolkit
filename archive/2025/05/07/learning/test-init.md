**Initialization Prompt: Resuming Session for Main serverless.yml file for Project 'LibellusAPI' (provided by user)**

**Objective:** To seamlessly resume our collaborative analysis and methodology refinement.

**(I) Session Context & Goal:**

*   **Overall Analytical Goal:** Analyze serverless.yml to identify all Lambda functions, their DLQ configurations, and associated CloudWatch alarm setups to ensure alarms do not trigger during function retry periods.
*   **Meta-Goal:** Refine AI-assisted methodology for serverless configuration analysis and establish best practices for prompt engineering within this specific domain.
*   **`serverless.yml` Context:** [Standard reminder: e.g., "The full YAML content was provided previously and should be considered available context."]

**(II) Methodology & Personas:**

*   **Primary AI Persona for This Session:** Serverless Configuration Analyst
*   **Agreed Interaction Style:** A structured, step-by-step analytical process, where the AI proposes analytical steps or asks targeted questions, and the user provides confirmation, data, or guidance. Insights are built collaboratively.
*   **Available Expert Personas:** `DataSchema Architect`, `Automation Specialist`, `Systems Thinking Advisor`, 
*   **Key Epistemological/Ethical Commitments:** All analyses and recommendations must be traceable to specific sections of the provided serverless.yml or explicitly stated AWS best practices. Assumptions will be clearly noted. Adherence to 'Exemplar Actionable Prompt Standards Checklist v1.0'.

**(III) Key Artifacts & Schemas (Referenced):**
*   `serverless.yml (Project LibellusAPI)`: 1.4.0 (Status: final | ID: art_001_serverless_yml | Details: The primary serverless configuration file for the Libellus API project, serving as the main subject of analysis.)
*   `Session State Object Schema`: 2.0.0 (Status: final | ID: art_002_session_state_schema | Details: The JSON schema defining the structure of this session state object, used for context management and persistence.)
*   `Exemplar Actionable Prompt Standards Checklist`: 1.0 (Status: final | ID: art_003_prompt_standards_checklist | Details: Checklist used to ensure the quality and effectiveness of AI prompts.)

**(IV) Previous Session Summary & State:**

*   **Last Completed Phase/Action:** Completed definition and agreement on Session State Object Schema v2.0. Preparing to generate sample data instance for prompt testing.
*   **Key Learnings/Insights Recap:**
    *   A detailed and extensible session state schema (like v2.0) is foundational for managing context in complex, multi-turn AI-assisted tasks.
    *   Explicitly defining AI personas, interaction styles, and project objectives within the session state enhances clarity and alignment.
    *   Versioning of schemas and artifacts is crucial for traceability and iterative development.
*   **Current State of Data/Analysis:** After a deep dive into prompt engineering standards and the creation of a comprehensive Session State Object Schema v2.0, we are now poised to test the Master Initialization Prompt Generator. The goal is to leverage these foundational assets for a more structured and effective analysis of the serverless.yml file, specifically concerning alarm configurations and DLQ retries.
*   **Open Questions/Issues:**
    *   How effectively will the older v1.1 Master Initialization Prompt Generator's Handlebars template map data from the richer v2.0 Session State Object instance?

**(V) Immediate Next Step / Focus for This Session:**

*   Using the provided Session State Object (v2.0 instance), generate a new Master Initialization Prompt by executing the 'Instructional Prompt: Master Initialization Prompt Generation - v1.1'.
*   *(Intended Persona: `PromptExecutionEngine_v1`)*
