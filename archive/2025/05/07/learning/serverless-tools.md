# Serverless Analysis Enhancement Menu

Here are the key proposals from our expert panel, categorized for clarity. Consider these as potential next steps or development items to supercharge your `serverless.yml` investigation:

---

## Category 1: Foundational Data Structures & Schemas

*   **Option 1.1: Define `ServerlessFunctionProfile_v1.0` Schema**
    *   **Concept:** Create a dedicated, detailed JSON schema to represent all relevant data points extracted for *each individual Lambda function* from your `serverless.yml`.
    *   **Core Benefit:** Establishes a consistent, validatable, and queryable structure for your primary data, making targeted analysis much more efficient and reliable.
    *   **Experts:** Ms. Chen

*   **Option 1.2: Enhance `ServerlessFunctionProfile` with Relationship Mapping**
    *   **Concept:** Extend the `ServerlessFunctionProfile_v1.0` schema (from Option 1.1) to include explicit fields for mapping inter-function relationships (e.g., `eventSources`, `downstreamDependencies`, `sharedResourceReferences`).
    *   **Core Benefit:** Enables a more systemic understanding by allowing the tracking and analysis of how functions connect and impact one another.
    *   **Experts:** Dr. Finnigan

## Category 2: Automated Analysis & Extraction Tools (AI-Driven Prompts/Tools)

*   **Option 2.1: Develop `ServerlessYAML_to_Profile_Extractor` Tool**
    *   **Concept:** An AI-driven prompt or tool designed to parse the `serverless.yml` content and automatically populate an array of `ServerlessFunctionProfile_v1.0` objects (from Option 1.1).
    *   **Core Benefit:** Automates the laborious initial data collection phase, ensuring accuracy and completeness based on the defined schema. Includes robust error handling for variations in the YAML.
    *   **Experts:** Ms. Chen, Dr. Pendergast

*   **Option 2.2: Develop `Serverless_Alarm_Retry_Correlator` Tool**
    *   **Concept:** A specialized analytical prompt/tool that takes the extracted `ServerlessFunctionProfile` data to specifically identify and report on functions where alarm configurations might conflict with or be inappropriately triggered by DLQ retry mechanisms.
    *   **Core Benefit:** Directly targets your primary concern regarding alarms and retries with a focused, automated analysis.
    *   **Experts:** Dr. Pendergast

*   **Option 2.3: Develop `Serverless_Config_Auditor` Tool**
    *   **Concept:** A more general analytical prompt/tool that audits the `ServerlessFunctionProfile` data against a configurable set of rules or best practices (e.g., security settings, performance parameters, specific environment variable presence).
    *   **Core Benefit:** Offers automated compliance checking and identification of a broader range of potential misconfigurations or areas for optimization.
    *   **Experts:** Dr. Pendergast

*   **Option 2.4: Develop `Serverless_Dependency_Mapper` Tool**
    *   **Concept:** An analytical prompt/tool (potentially guiding the generation of visual diagram inputs) that uses the enhanced `ServerlessFunctionProfile` data (from Option 1.2) to map out and describe key function call chains, shared resource contention points, or complex retry loops.
    *   **Core Benefit:** Provides deeper systemic insights into operational flow and potential cascading failure points.
    *   **Experts:** Dr. Finnigan

## Category 3: Enhanced Interaction & Analytical Methodology

*   **Option 3.1: Implement a "Serverless Systems Analyst" AI Persona**
    *   **Concept:** Define and utilize a specialized AI persona (e.g., "Serverless Systems Analyst") within the `methodology_context` of your `Session State Object v2.0`. This persona would be tailored with the core capabilities and role description relevant to `serverless.yml` analysis.
    *   **Core Benefit:** Ensures you're interacting with an AI configured with the appropriate expertise and focus for this specific, complex task, leading to more relevant and insightful assistance.
    *   **Experts:** Prof. Li

*   **Option 3.2: Employ "Guided Discovery Prompts" for Analysis**
    *   **Concept:** Shift the interaction style from making broad requests to a more iterative, conversational approach where the "Serverless Systems Analyst" AI persona guides you through the analysis step-by-step, based on your high-level goals.
    *   **Core Benefit:** Makes the analysis more manageable, adaptable, and allows for a co-construction of understanding, where insights are built collaboratively.
    *   **Experts:** Prof. Li

## Category 4: Holistic Context Management & Iterative Process

*   **Option 4.1: Fully Integrate `serverless.yml` Analysis with `Session State Object v2.0`**
    *   **Concept:** Actively and comprehensively use all relevant sections of the `Session State Object Schema v2.0` (e.g., `project_context.strategic_objectives` to define analysis goals, `artifact_manifest` to track `serverless.yml` versions and extracted profiles, `session_history_summary` to log insights and unresolved questions, `current_focus` to direct each step) to manage the `serverless.yml` analysis as an ongoing, context-rich project.
    *   **Core Benefit:** Maximizes continuity across potentially multiple analysis sessions, ensures that evolving understanding is captured, and supports complex, multi-step investigations systematically.
    *   **Experts:** Ms. Chen, Dr. Finnigan, Prof. Li
