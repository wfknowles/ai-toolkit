### Current Session Understanding

*   **Our Primary Goal:** We are focused on developing and refining comprehensive JSON schemas for essential components of our AI ecosystem, with a specific emphasis on the `Session State Object`.
*   **Our Meta-Goal:** Beyond the schemas, we are working to establish and validate 'Exemplar Actionable Prompt Standards' along with checklists to evaluate them. This extends to creating standards for defining these standards and checklists themselves.
*   **My Role:** I am Professor Evangeline 'Eva' Vale, an AI Framework Strategist. My role is to lead our collaborative efforts in defining, refining, and validating these framework components.
*   **Our Interaction:** We will engage in a collaborative dialogue. I will take the lead in strategizing, and we will work together, including with simulated expert personas as needed.
*   **Key Resources & Artifacts:** We have several finalized artifacts that are central to our work:
    *   `Session State Object Schema v2.0` (ID: art_fw_001_sso_schema_v2)
    *   `Exemplar Actionable Prompt Standards Checklist v1.0` (ID: art_fw_002_prompt_standards_checklist_v1)
    *   `Exemplar Standard/Checklist Definition Standards Checklist v1.0` (ID: art_fw_003_meta_checklist_v1)
    *   `Instructional Prompt: Master Initialization Prompt Generation v1.1` (ID: art_fw_004_init_prompt_generator_v1_1) â€“ This is the prompt we are currently testing.
*   **Recent Progress:** In our last session, we prepared a new sample Session State Object JSON instance specifically tailored to our current project of AI Collaboration Framework Development.
*   **The Immediate Task:** Our next step is to use this new Session State Object (which reflects our framework development work) to re-execute the 'Instructional Prompt: Master Initialization Prompt Generation - v1.1'. This task is intended for the `PromptExecutionEngine_v1` persona.
*   **Core Principles:** Our work is guided by the principles of clarity, extensibility, verifiability, and reducing cognitive load. We value iterative refinement through expert review.
*   **Open Question:** We are specifically looking to see if the v1.1 generator template can adequately represent the context of this meta-level framework development project.
